## Closing the Research Gap

<!-- Rehash intro and motivation and then summarise how each chapter links to the research gaps/questions/objectives. -->
Needleleaf forests have an important control on the partitioning the fraction and the phase of precipitation reaching the ground. In cold climate forests, around half of annual snowfall may be lost to the atmosphere via canopy snow sublimation and in warmer climates increased melt rates increases the liquid fraction of precipitation reaching the ground. However, sparse observations of canopy snow processes and forest snow accumulation has led to limited testing of these theories leading to uncertain application when applied in hydrological models across the globe. This uncertainty contributes to limited or uncertain process diagnosis and prediction of land-surface albedo, snow accumulation, and subsequent water resources in forested cold regions environments. Moreover, as the global climate warms there is a need to ensure existing theories to represent snow interception processes are robust across a range of meteorological conditions and forest types. The primary goal this research aimed to address was to first investigate the theories and assumptions underpinning current forest snow accumulation models and determine if existing theories are supported by in-situ observations collected from a needleleaf subalpine forest. This approach helped identify where existing approaches were most uncertain and then aimed to propose solutions to improve model accuracy. Overall this thesis aims to bridge the gap between developments in process understanding through field-based observations to implementation and validation in models.

In Chapter 2 a comprehensive literature review is presented to establish major gaps in the literature. In this review the theories and assumptions underpinning existing snow interception and canopy snow ablation parameterisations are presented addressing Research Question 1 of Objective 1. Several differing approaches for representing forest-snow interactions were identified in this review. Although the decision to implement certain approaches was typically over simplified with one approach being best for "sticky" versus "dry" snow it was also revealed that there has been little consideration for thier transferability in more diverse envrionements such as sparse or discontinuous canopies and meteorological conditions such as warm, humid, cold, windy or differing combinations. The differing process behaviour and number of processes included in existing forest snow accumulation models is typically equated to differing environmental conditions in previous studies. However, this work outlines that existing uncertainties in measurements also likely contributes to the differing process behaviour. Existing initial snow interception parameterisations were developed using measurements that were not isolated from ablation processes and therefore have uncertain applicability when combined with additional ablation parameterisations. This mixing of processes in measurements and resulting parameterisations introduces potential double counting of processes in hydrological models. Canopy snow unloading measurements are shown to be difficult to collect across the literature and has led to limited and sparse measurements. As a result, current canopy snow unloading parameterisations are based on indirect measurements of canopy snow unloading from above canopy albedo [e.g., @Roesch2001] which may also incorporate sublimation losses. Moreover, many previous studies have noted challenges in isolating individual canopy snow ablation processes resulting in difficulties differenciating between ablation of canopy snow as solid (unloading) and liquid (drip) during unloading. Thus, to address this research gap additional direct measurements of canopy snow unloading are needed and hybrid approaches to help differentiate processes where they cannot be measured using the best information available. It was also identified that previous snow interception parameterizations were developed on relatively small spacial scales (point to, transect) and over longer time periods by some studies (weeks). Therefore, there it was determined there is a need for additional observations of forest-snow interactions that traverse multiple temporal and spatial scales. To better evaluate process representation the observations collected in this study focused on isolating individual processes in the canopy snow mass balance in an effort to both evaluate the assumptions underlying existing models and develop new parameterisations that are isolated to a single process.

Chapter 3 aimed to address several research gaps regarding process understanding of initial accumulation of snow in the canopy. Specifically, several existing snow interception parameterisations increase throughfall of snow with increasing canopy snow loads and air temperature. Moreover, existing relationships have largely been developed in dense forest canopies and therefore this study aimed to investigate the relationship of initial snow interception across a wide range of canopy coverages. To determine if this relationship is due to alterations in canopy density resulting from branch bending or increases in canopy snow unloading, new observations were collected which limited the inclusion of canopy snow ablation processes. To facilitate this 15-minute interval measurements of subcanopy snow accumulation were carefully collected using time-lapse imagery, and threshold checks (to ensure throughfall plus unloading was less than the snowfall rate) ensuring that these measurements limited their inclusion of canopy snow ablation. This research showed that existing theories of a maximum canopy snow load capacity and air temperature on initial interception were not applicable at this study site and are more likely due to previous studies including unloading within the interception measurements. Branch bending related to both air temperature and canopy snow load was hypothesized to balance out increases in contact area as snow bridged gaps in the canopy while the horizontal areal coverage of the canopy declined as branches bend. This process was also hypothesized to contribute to the limited influence of air temperature on interception efficiency as snow becomes stickier, branches also bend easier and reduced the leaf contact area. Interception efficiency, before ablation was found to be most strongly related to leaf-contact area which is also moderated by hydrometeor trajectory angle, and can be approximated using only wind speed, canopy coverage, and hydrometeor velocity. An existing relationship to describe the change in leaf-contact area with hydrometeor trajectory angle failed to represent observations collected in this study. Based on the invalidation of the assumptions of previous interception theroies of maxoimum canopy snow load, air temperature influence, and new relationship between leaf contact area and hydrometeor trajectory angle two new parameterisations are presented. First leaf contact area is shown to be approximated from estimated hydrometeor trajectory angle and nadir canopy cover. Second, similar to some rainfall interception parameterisations initial interception is calculated as a function of snowfall and leaf contact area and a efficiency parameter. Incorporating this snowfall vector-based canopy density metric improved the prediction in a diverse canopy across a broad range in canopy densities providing confidence in this parameterisation across a broad range of canopy structures.

In Chapter 4 new observations of canopy snow ablation were collected over events with meteorological conditions representative of climates ranging from the cold boreal forest to temperate maritime and provided new insights on processes governing unloading and melt/drip of intercepted snow. Direct measurements of canopy snow unloading, which provide important results as previous studies typically relied on in-direct observations of canopy snow unloading to parameterisae parameterisations, revealed canopy snow load, wind shear stress, and the canopy snowmelt rate were primary predictors of canopy snow unloading. These findings corroborate with several existing studies suggesting the importance of both cold/dry and melt-induced unloading, however the observed relationships differed in terms of the exact predictor variables used to represent both types of unloading. For example, both wind-shear stress showed improved predictibility over wind speed alone and likely relates to its improved physical basis. Moreover, while temperature index models have showed some success in representing melt-induced unloading of snow intercepted in the canopy they showed drastically reduced performance compared to a physically based energy balance canopy snowmelt routine. These findings highlight the importance of providing a comprehensive representation of both dry and melt-induced unloading as well as more physically based methods (wind shear stress instead of wind speed, energy balance based snowmelt vs temperature index methods). Moreover, a new relationship was found showing the amount of solid snow unloading during canopy snowmelt increased linearly with canopy snow load. Since existing canopy snow unloading routines were developed considering initial accumulation routines which also included unloading the relationships presented here are thought to be more compatible with routines that only calculate unloading. The maximum canopy snow load also implemented in many existing canopy snow ablation was not observed over our study period and the canopy snow loads measured were much higher than existing theories of maximum canopy snow load predicted. All canopy snow models had the highest error in simulating canopy snow load for cold and dry events.

In Chapter 5 a new model to represent the mass and energy balance of snow intercepted in the canopy were incorporated as a new module in CRHM which aims to address limitations of previous approaches identified in this study. Subcanopy SWE observations collected at four research basins located in western Canada which consist of diverse forest species, forest structure, and climates to evaluate simulated forest SWE using a novel and existing canopy snow model. Snow interception models have been tested at relatively few locations and thus this study presents an important contribution in testing models at additional locations. - The updated model saw relatively similar performance at Fortress, Marmot, and Wolf Creek compared to the existing model. However, substantial improvement was found on the coastal-warm-humid Russell Creek site due to the misrepresentation of the canopy snowmelt/drip/unloading process in the existing model.  Although both models show good performance at Fortress, Marmot and Wolf Creek there is a large difference in the fraction of intercepted snow that is sublimated, particularly for Marmot where 10% more snowfall was sublimated for the new model compared to the old one due to higher unloading rates in the old model In additional to evaluating the two modules on forest SWE accumulation, a model process diagnosis was conducted to determine why the new and existing approaches produce differing results. Moreover, the missing procesess identified in this work suggest existing estimates of forest-snow intercactions, with implications for water resources and land-surface energy exchanges may be in error if outside of regions these exsiting parameterisations were developed and or calibrated. The results presented here suggest improved transferability of forest-snow interaction models across diverse canopy structures and climates. Moreover, the flexible modular nature of the model should enable easier implementation of new canopy snow interception ablation routines as they are further developed based on new observations or parameters adjusted using machine learning models.

## How does this work push the discipline forward?

### Process-based Diagnosis of Existing Theory

Many advances in hydrology have arisen from diagnosing individual processes to improve their representation as parameterisations in hydrological models [e.g., @Pomeroy1993; @Aubry-Wake2023; @Rutter1971; @Freer2002a]. These parameterisations are only as robust as the observations underpinning them, making the quality of input data a critical factor. This thesis placed particular emphasis on collecting detailed hydrometeorological observations, enabling the level of process-focused analysis conducted here. These observations provide an advance compared to previous approaches which relied on monitoring snow interception processes as time scales of days to months [e.g., @Hedstrom1998] and covering spatial scales limited to points to linear transects of tens of metres [e.g., @Storck2002; @Hedstrom1998] which previously limited process-level understanding as the increased time span and limited spatial scales either combined or limited process understanding. More recently several studies have investigated relationships between UAV-LiDAR derived canopy metrics [@Staines2023; @Moeser2015b; @Roth2019] and subcanopy SWE. As a result, these studies are limited in the process-level advances in understanding. This thesis provides the first linkage between highly resolved throughfall observations and canopy structure derived from UAV-LiDAR, while also integrating subcanopy lysimeter measurements at high temporal frequency. Combining these novel datasets helps ensure consistency of process understanding across both spatial and temporal scales.

Existing approaches significantly underestimate the amount of snow intercepted in the canopy due to some inclusion of the unloading process in the initial interception process. Existing models were found to overemphasize the canopy snow unloading process with overlapping parameterisations to represent this process also each with individual empirical coefficients which could contribute to equifinality in models that use a calibration based approach.

### Revised Theory on Snow Interception 

In addition to evaluating existing theories on field measurements this thesis provided a holistic approach involving linking of the new insights to process understanding in addition to next steps on how to address limitations on existing approaches. Provides a new forest-snow partitioning diagnosis tool with improved confidence across forest and climate types. Existing canopy snow interception parameterisations were shown to achieve the right answer for the wrong reason and may contribute to the lack of transferability of existing approaches to new sites.

The new relationships revealed through this work highlight the variability of snow interception processes in sparse forest canopies across varying canopy densities. However, hydrological and land surface models typically split land cover into forested and non-forested units and do not represent the heterogeneity of snow processes in these environments. The research here shows that initial interception efficiency can vary by a factor of 2 depending on wind speed and hydrometeor velocity. This has broad implications for the implementation of hydrological research units in hydrological models and their equivalent in land surface schemes. Improved representation for snow accumulation in forests could result from treating forests as a continuos spectrum in canopy densities which can be adjusted using the snow-leaf contact area parameterisation as a function of hydrometeor trajectory angle. The revised model is also more consistent with many rainfall interception studies. 

New relationships to represent canopy snow unloading and melt were presented and highlighted the importance of providing a comprehensive representation of the canopy snow mass and energy balance compared to previous approaches which were missing key processes and resulted in erroneous subcanopy SWE simulations and individual canopy snow process representations. The idea of differing unloading rates across tree species could replace the concept of a species or canopy dependent maximum canopy snow load used by current models. The new proposed equations here better represent individual forest-snow processes and have shown better transferability across differing sites and future climates.

### Model Philosophy on Targeting Individual Processes with Individual Parameterisations 

Another contribution of this thesis is the emphasis that hydrological parameterisations should target individual dominant processes, rather than combining multiple processes into single formulations. By dedicating interception parameterisations to a single process, they become more compatible with modular model frameworks [e.g., @Pomeroy2022; @Clark2015b]. For example many canopy snow models implement two parameters for unloading (one during the initial accumulation of snow in the canopy and a second post snowfall) these two processes contribute to issues with equifinality [@Beven2006a].

### Model Framework for Understanding Changes to Snow Storage in Forested Basins

Finally, although not the primary focus, this research provides new insights into how climate and vegetation change will alter snow–forest interactions. The results show how similar snowfall amounts to open environments can result in very large differences in subcanopy snow accumulation depending on both climate and canopy density. Results demonstrate that similar snowfall amounts can produce vastly different subcanopy snow accumulations depending on canopy density and climate regime. For example, in warm-maritime climates, most snowfall reaches the ground (though phase and timing are altered), whereas in cold–dry continental climates, canopy sublimation leads to significant losses.

These findings caution against extrapolating snow storage estimates from open sites [as suggested by @Raleigh2025] to forested environments. As climates warm, canopy snow regimes may shift from sublimation-dominated processes to melt-dominated ones, altering both the timing and quantity of snow reaching the ground. The parameterisations and model framework developed in this thesis provide tools to diagnose and predict such transitions, with direct implications for snow hydrology in forested cold regions and for broader land surface modelling schemes.

## Future Directions

Future work regarding forest-snow interactions is needed to help further constrain potential uncertainties in the work presented here and to also mobilise the outcomes of this work as a decision making tool for quantifying and understanding changes to water resources in cold regions forests. For example, empirical coefficients were developed associated with the various new relationships presented here to represent initial interception, canopy density, unloading and need further validation across differing canopy species and climates. To do this process-level observations of the individual components of the canopy snow energy and mass balance. Differing forest species may have different initial interception coeffcients, such as more pine dominant or larch forests. As well, deciduous or broadleaf canopies have received very little attension in the literature but are extensive in many snow covered zones across the globe. The shape of individual broadleaf trees is also expected to result in a differing relationship of snow-leaf contact area with hydrometeor trajectory angle compared to the coniferous trees observed in this study. While little change in cohesion and adhesion of snow was observed in this study, these forces are known to be temperature dependent and furter work could help confirm if representing these proceses improves the calculation of interception efficiency.

Differing unloading rates are also expected across differing forest species and climates. While not the focus of this study, parameterisations involved in both the initial interception and subsequent ablation processes are expected to differ across various sites. Despite this satisfactory model performance was acheived using the baseline parameters developed at Fortress, future work could help determine ranges of appropriate parameters for different locations with differing forest species, forest structure, and climates. Specific parameterise which likely require site specific calibration include: the interception efficiency parameter (may be lower for some species i.e., hemlock, cedar, deciduous or higher for climates with increased precipitation near the melting point), parameters for wind-induced and melt-induced unloading are likely also site specific and relate to several factors (i.e., tree species, forest structure, climate), several parameters are also used to help with approximations in the energy balance of canopy snow as well. For example, large intercepted loads are often observed in the canopy in maritime regions due to freeze/thawing in the canopy where ablation rates are likely lower than those observed in this study. Moreover, the rigidity and size of individual branches resulting from species, age, and temperature will influence degree of compression of individual branches with increasing snow load altering the rate and association of unloading with snow load. Humid climates also exhibit significant accumulation of rime-ice in the canopy which has a high resistance to unloading. Both rime-ice and snow that melts and refreezes to the canopy could be represented by adding an ice reservoir in models to simulate the increased resistance to unloading. However, since this type of snow load was not observed in our research this model feature could not be tested and was thus not implemented.

High resolution global datasets of canopy coverage will ensure the application of these new algorithms at large extents. Moreover, knowing the species of individual trees will also help parameterise the likely species dependent coefficients. Making informed decisions using hydrological models and land-surface schemes rely on robust meteorological forcing data often downscaled to in-situ station data. The importance of in-situ station data in areas where significant water is stored and areas where meteorological data is currently most uncertain. 

Future water resource studies and monitoring efforts should increase the consideration of forested areas which historically quantify water availability using observed SWE in open areas. Although this has worked in the past shifting forest-snow hydrological regimes will likely impact these relationships as a result of changing to the quantity, phase, and timing of snowfall/meltwater reaching the ground. 

Models that parameterise the dominant processes important for snow redistribution (e.g. @Marsh2024) are and important compoent which allow for large extent mobilising of computationally expensive physics based routines across large areas. 

The transferability of the new canopy snow model presented in this thesis across diverse climate and forest types in Canada provide some confidence in the use of this model in conjunction with a physically based hydrological model (CRHM, CHM, SUMMA) as a diagnostic tool to investigate snow storage in forests around the world. Since remote sensing of SWE in forest environments remains limited, this model diagnostic tool can help researchers quantify water storage as snow in forests. Moreover, as climates and vegetation extents shift there is a need to investigate the influence of these changes of snow accumulation in forests. This diagnostic tool has to potential to help decision makers make informed decision on future changes to water availability in cold regions forests given the strong dependence of forest snow partitioning on canopy density and temperature (through melt unloading, and sublimation processes) the impacts of future changes in forests are expected to be significant and warrent investigation.
