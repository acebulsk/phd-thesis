## Closing the Research Gap

<!-- Rehash intro and motivation and then summarise how each chapter links to the research gaps/questions/objectives. -->
Needleleaf forest canopies can intercept a large fraction of snowfall and expose this snow to increased energy fluxes governing the quantity, timing, and phase of precipitation reaching the ground. In continental climates, around half of annual snowfall may be lost to the atmosphere via canopy snow sublimation and in warmer climates higher melt rates increase the liquid fraction of precipitation reaching the ground. However, sparse observations of canopy snow processes and forest snow accumulation has led to limited testing of these theories leading to uncertain application when applied in hydrological models across the globe. This uncertainty contributes to limited or uncertain process diagnosis and prediction of land-surface albedo, snow accumulation, and subsequent water resources in forests that receive snowfall. Moreover, as the global climate warms there is a need to ensure existing theories to represent snow interception processes are robust across a range of meteorological conditions and evolving forests. The primary goal this research aimed to address was to first investigate the theories and assumptions underpinning current forest snow accumulation models and determine if existing theories are supported by in-situ observations collected across a wide range of canopy densities and meteorologies. This thesis also links this improved process understanding to model development and validation in order to test new theories across a range of climate and forest densities.

In Chapter 2 a comprehensive literature review was presented to establish major gaps in the literature. In this review the theories and assumptions underpinning existing snow interception and canopy snow ablation parameterisations are presented addressing Research Question 1 of Objective 1. Through this review it was revealed that there has been little consideration for the transferability of existing parameterisations across a range of canopy densities or meteorological conditions. Moreover, existing discussions of differing process behaviour and number of processes included in existing models is typically equated to differing environmental conditions in previous studies. However, this work outlines that differing methodological approaches for measuring individual processes also contributes to the differing relationships. Existing theories of initial interception [i.e., @Satterlund1967; @Schmidt1991; @Hedstrom1998], showed a strong increase in throughfall with increasing canopy snow load and air temperature. However, the long duration of snowfall events and temperatures occasionally near the melting point greatly increase the probability of unloading within these measurements. This mixing of processes in measurements and resulting parameterisations introduces potential double counting of processes in hydrological models if these initial interception parameterisations are also combined with a comprehensive canopy snow unloading routine without calibration. It was also identified that previous snow interception parameterisations were developed on relatively small spacial scales (point to, transect) and over longer time periods by some studies (weeks). Therefore, it was determined there is a need for additional observations of forest-snow interactions that traverse multiple temporal and spatial scales. Canopy snow unloading measurements are shown to be difficult to collect across the literature and has led to limited and sparse measurements. As a result, current canopy snow unloading parameterisations are based on indirect measurements of canopy snow unloading from above canopy albedo [e.g., @Roesch2001] which may also incorporate other ablation processes than unloading (i.e., sublimation losses). Moreover, many previous studies have noted challenges in isolating individual canopy snow ablation processes resulting in difficulties differentiating between ablation of canopy snow as solid (unloading) and liquid (drip) during unloading. Thus, to address this research gap additional direct measurements of canopy snow unloading are needed and hybrid approaches to help differentiate processes where they cannot be measured using the best information available. To better evaluate process representation the observations collected in this study focused on isolating individual processes in the canopy snow mass balance in an effort to both evaluate the assumptions underlying existing models and develop new parameterisations that are isolated to a single process.

Chapter 3 aimed to address several research gaps regarding process understanding of initial accumulation of snow in needleleaf canopies. The relationship between initial interception with canopy snow load and air temperature was evaluated using observations of throughfall that limited the inclusion of canopy snow ablation processes (i.e., unloading). To ensure measurements of throughfall limited the inclusion of unloading and drip, 15-minute interval measurements were assessed using time-lapse imagery, a weighed tree, and threshold checks (to check throughfall plus unloading was less than the snowfall rate) to ensure that these measurements limited their inclusion of canopy snow ablation. The findings indicated that established theories regarding maximum canopy snow load capacity and the influence of air temperature on initial interception did not hold at this study site. This discrepancy is likely because earlier studies incorporated unloading processes within their interception measurements. It was hypothesised that branch compression, influenced by both air temperature and canopy snow load, together with the expansion of contact area as snow bridged canopy gaps and variations in snow adhesion and cohesion, offset these opposing relationships with interception, thereby limiting their detection in this study. A second research gap this chapter addressed is that existing relationships have largely been developed in dense forest canopies and therefore this study aimed to investigate the relationship of initial snow interception across a broad range in canopy densities. In a subalpine forest with variable canopy density, it was found interception efficiency before ablation could be predicted by snow-leaf contact area which is also moderated by hydrometeor trajectory angle, and can be approximated using only wind speed, canopy coverage, and hydrometeor velocity. An existing relationship to describe the change in leaf-contact area with hydrometeor trajectory angle failed to represent observations collected in this study. Based on the invalidation of the assumptions of previous interception theories of maximum canopy snow load, air temperature influence, and new relationship between leaf contact area and hydrometeor trajectory angle two new parameterisations are presented. First leaf contact area is shown to be approximated from estimated from wind speed, hydrometeor velocity, and nadir canopy cover. By limiting the amount of ablation in the initial interception measurements this new model is based on it is thought to be more compatible with canopy snow ablation parameterisations that include a comprehensive representation of unloading, melt/drip, and sublimation processes. Second, similar to some rainfall interception parameterisations initial interception is calculated as a function of snowfall and leaf contact area and an efficiency parameter. Incorporating this snowfall vector-based canopy density metric improved the prediction of throughfall in a diverse canopy across a broad range in canopy densities and meteorological conditions.

In Chapter 4 new observations of canopy snow ablation were presented—collected over events with meteorological conditions representative of climates ranging from the cold boreal forest to temperate maritime—and provided new insights on processes governing unloading and melt/drip of intercepted snow. The direct measurements of canopy snow unloading presented here provide an important contribution to the literature as previous studies typically relied on in-direct observations of canopy snow unloading to parameterise parameterisations and may have been influenced by other processes than unloading (e.g., above canopy albedo is influenced by unloading, melt, and sublimation). These new observations identified canopy snow load, wind shear stress, and the canopy snowmelt rate as primary predictors of unloading. These results align with previous studies emphasizing the importance of representing both cold/dry and melt-induced unloading processes. However, the relationships observed here incorporated predictors with stronger physical foundations. For example, wind shear stress provided improved predictive power than wind speed, likely due to its more direct representation of the mechanical forces acting on intercepted snow. Similarly, a physically based energy balance approach to melt and unload canopy snow offered improved performance compared to temperature index models. In addition, a new linear relationship was identified, showing that the amount of solid snow unloading during melt events increased proportionally with canopy snow load. Collectively, these findings underscore the importance of representing both dry and melt-induced unloading and prioritizing physically based methods, such as wind shear stress over wind speed and energy balance approaches over temperature index models. They also provide new context for the maximum canopy snow load used in previous interception and ablation models, demonstrating that unloading increases proportionally with canopy snow load rather than reaching a fixed threshold. The weak influence of canopy snow load on throughfall observed in Chapter 3 is likely explained by this strong dependence, with unloading occurring before canopy coverage can be substantially modified. 

In Chapter 5 a new model to represent the mass and energy balance of snow intercepted in the canopy were incorporated as a new module in CRHM which aims to address limitations of previous approaches identified in this study. The updated model had substantial reduction in simulated SWE error at the warm-humid Russell Creek site due to the misrepresentation of the canopy snowmelt/drip/unloading process in the existing model. The reduction in error by the new model was smaller at the three cold climate sites (Fortress, Marmot, and Wolf Creek) compared to the existing model. Although both models show good performance at Fortress, Marmot and Wolf Creek there is a large difference in the amount and duration of snow load intercepted in the canopy. Although the net quantity of snow/meltwater reaching the ground was relatively similar in the three colder climate sites between the two models the large difference in simulated canopy snow load has implications for surface albedo representation in land-surface schemes. The results presented here suggest improved transferability of forest-snow interaction models across diverse canopy structures and climates. These results also highlight the strong dependence of forest-snow interactions on both climate and canopy structure with a large variability observed between the amount and timing of snowfall reaching the ground across all sites with around half of snowfall lost to the atmosphere via sublimation at two lower snowfall sites. Higher snowfall rates coupled with increased wind speed resulted in reduced atmospheric losses. The maritime climate sites had nearly half of annual snowfall melt within the canopy, leading to low sublimation losses. Moreover, the flexible modular nature of the model should enable easier implementation of new canopy snow interception ablation routines as they are further developed based on new observations or parameters adjusted using machine learning models.

## How does this work push the discipline forward?

### Process-based Diagnosis of Existing Theory

Many advances in hydrology have arisen from diagnosing individual processes to improve their representation as parameterisations in hydrological models [e.g., @Pomeroy1993; @Aubry-Wake2023; @Rutter1971; @Freer2002a]. The robustness of such parameterisations depends on the quality of the underlying observations, making detailed measurements essential. This thesis placed particular emphasis on collecting careful, detailed observations to enable process-focused analysis which has previously been limited. As a result, throughfall/interception measurements could be better isolated from unloading/ablation processes contributing to an assessment of snow interception relationships that better reflects the individual process. In addition to isolating process measurements, observations were collected across varying canopy density and meteorological conditions stress testing relationships across diverse conditions. New advances in UAV-lidar technology allow the collection of canopy density and structure measurements over large areas [@Staines2023; @Moeser2015b; @Roth2019], however corresponding process measurements at matching high resolution (i.e., throughfall) have been limited. This thesis provides the first linkage between highly resolved throughfall observations and canopy structure derived from UAV-LiDAR, while also integrating subcanopy lysimeter measurements at high temporal frequency to push process understanding across a broad range in both canopy density and meteorology.

### Advancing Theories of Snowfall Partitioning by Forest Canopies 

In addition to evaluating existing theories with field measurements, this thesis develops a holistic framework that connects new insights on canopy snow processes to both process understanding and practical steps for overcoming limitations of current approaches. New parameterisations are introduced to represent forest–snow partitioning, providing greater confidence across diverse forest and climate types. By more explicitly representing the underlying physical processes, these parameterisations reduce the likelihood of achieving the right answer for the wrong reason and enhance the potential for transferability to new sites.

The new relationships revealed through this work highlight the variability of snow interception processes in sparse forest canopies across varying canopy densities. Yet it was shown this variability could be represented using commonly available input data (wind speed, canopy cover, and hydrometeor fall velocity) across a broad range in meteorological conditions. However, most hydrological and land surface models classify land cover into broad forested and non-forested categories, failing to capture the heterogeneity of snow processes in these environments. Results from this thesis demonstrate that interception efficiency in sparse canopies can vary by a factor of two for ~1m s^-1^ wind speeds—variability that mosaic/binary land cover partitioning cannot resolve. This finding highlights the importance of treating forests as a continuous spectrum of canopy densities in order to more accurately represent the variability of possible interception efficiencies in these diverse forests. The revised approach not only advances representation of snow accumulation in forests but also aligns more closely with rainfall interception studies, providing a more consistent and transferable framework.

New relationships building on new observations and existing theories were developed to represent canopy snow unloading and melt, resulting in improved estimates of subcanopy SWE, canopy snow load, canopy snow cover duration, and individual processes (sublimation, unloading, and melt/drip). These advances highlight the importance of a comprehensive representation of the canopy snow mass and energy balance. Parameters for initial interception and unloading are now more directly linked to the processes they represent, improving the clarity and interpretability of model calculations. Collectively, the new equations better capture individual forest–snow processes and demonstrate stronger transferability across sites and under future climate conditions.

### Modelling Philosophy

Another contribution of this thesis is the emphasis that hydrological parameterisations should target individual dominant processes rather than combining multiple processes into a single formulation. By dedicating interception parameterisations to a single process, they become more compatible with modular model frameworks [e.g., @Pomeroy2022; @Clark2015b]. By separating unloading and ablation from the initial interception parameterisation, this work reduces potential model equifinality, as earlier approaches relied on two parameters to control unloading.

### Model Framework for Understanding Changes to Snow Storage in Forested Basins

These results provide new insights into developing diagnostic tools to investigate how climate and vegetation change will alter snow–forest interactions and have the potential to increase understanding of implications on downstream water resources. Both observations and simulations demonstrate that snowfall partitioning varies substantially with climatic regime and canopy density. The improved transferability of parameterisations diverse climate and forest types strengthens confidence in using this new model to diagnose future changes in forested basin snow storage under climate warming and vegetation shifts. These findings also highlight the risks of extrapolating snow storage estimates from open sites to forested areas in an evolving environment. As temperatures rise, canopy snow regimes may transition from sublimation-dominated processes to melt-dominated ones, altering both the timing and quantity of snow reaching the ground thus changing relationships between snow storage in open environments and total basin snow water storage. The parameterisations and model framework developed in this thesis provide tools to diagnose and predict such transitions, with direct implications for snow hydrology in forested basins and for land surface modelling schemes due to the influence of canopy snow coverage on albedo.

## Future Directions

Future work on forest-snow interactions is needed to continue developing understanding of snowfall partitioning by forest canopies and to mobilise these findings into decision-making tools for managing water resources in snow-dominated forested basins. The empirical coefficients developed to represent initial interception, canopy density, and unloading require further validation across differing forest species and climatic conditions. While these coefficients could be calibrated to reduce errors in subcanopy SWE or streamflow, this risks model equifinality—producing correct outputs through incorrect process representation, as seen in pre-existing models. A more robust approach, as demonstrated in this thesis, constrain parameters using process-level observations of the corresponding process. This method could be extended to determine appropriate parameter ranges for various forest types, structures, and climates.

This study examined spruce and fir forests, so the transferability of both the theoretical framework and empirical coefficients to pine, larch, and broadleaf canopies remains to be tested. A fundamental difference may occur in deciduous canopies where the shape of individual broadleaf trees is also expected to result in a differing relationship of snow-leaf contact area with hydrometeor trajectory angle compared to the coniferous trees observed in this study. Although cohesion and adhesion forces showed minimal variation in this study, their known temperature dependence warrants investigation into whether explicitly representing these processes improves interception efficiency calculations. Additionally, the species-specific canopy load capacities used in previous models likely relate to the unloading rate coefficients presented here. These parameters could capture differences in branch rigidity and size arising from species, age, and temperature—factors that influence branch compression under increasing snow load and thus affect unloading rates and their relationship with snow load. The canopy snow ablation measurements presented here were limited to four lysimters installed within a mixed fir and spruce forest plot and thus limited interpretation on how varied species and forest structure/density influences canopy snow ablation could be ascertained from these datasets. Future work could increase the number of subcanopy lysimeters installed across varied species and canopy densities. 

A key process that is likely important to represent in more transitional or maritime climates is the accumulation of ice through freeze-thaw cycles or rime-ice accretion. These ice chunks can engulf branches and resist unloading [@Lumbrazo2022] while also potentially altering turbulent energy exchanges by reducing wind flow compared to porous snow clumps. A canopy ice reservoir could be added to better represent these processes. However, since this type of snow load was not observed in our research this model feature could not be tested and was thus not implemented.

Additional validations of simulated subcanopy SWE over large spatial extents with the collection of UAV-lidar derived subcanopy snowdepths, and converted to SWE using observed or simulated snow densities. These datasets provide the potential to validate updates to the canopy snow model here over large spatial extents which could help further build confidence in these models. However, it will be important to consider the uncertainty in meteorological forcing which becomes more uncertain at larger extents away from station observations or using downscaled reanalysis meteorological data which will contribute to errors in simulated SWE in addition to the new parameterisations. 

High resolution global datasets of canopy coverage will ensure the application of these new algorithms at large extents. Moreover, knowing the species of individual trees will also help parameterise the likely species dependent coefficients. Making informed decisions using hydrological models and land-surface schemes rely on robust meteorological forcing data often downscaled to in-situ station data. The importance of in-situ station data in areas where significant water is stored and areas where meteorological data is currently most uncertain. 

Future water resource studies and monitoring efforts should increase the consideration of forested areas which historically quantify water availability using observed SWE in open areas. Although this has worked in the past shifting forest-snow hydrological regimes will likely impact these relationships as a result of changing to the quantity, phase, and timing of snowfall/meltwater reaching the ground. Could help inform monitoring efforts of water resources, snow stations in forested areas with significant snow accumulation in addition to sites in open. The importance of forests in warm areas... for holding snow water equivalent. 

The transferability of the new canopy snow model presented in this thesis across diverse climate and forest types in Canada provide some confidence in the use of this model in conjunction with a physically based hydrological model (CRHM, CHM, SUMMA) as a diagnostic tool to investigate snow storage in forests around the world. While significant advances in understanding snowfall partitioning by needleleaf forest canopies, one precipitation reaches the ground several other processes govern the amount of precipitation that contributes to runoff including but not limited to atmospheric losses by understory vegetation, uncertainties in surface snowpack melt routines, surface storage, infiltration, evapotranspiration, and subsurface storage and runoff processes. Since remote sensing of SWE in forest environments remains limited, this model diagnostic tool can help researchers quantify water storage as snow in forests. Moreover, as climates and vegetation extents shift there is a need to investigate the influence of these changes of snow accumulation in forests. This diagnostic tool has the potential to help decision makers make informed decision on future changes to water availability in cold regions forests given the strong dependence of forest snow partitioning on canopy density and temperature (through melt unloading, and sublimation processes) the impacts of future changes in forests are expected to be significant and warrant investigation.
