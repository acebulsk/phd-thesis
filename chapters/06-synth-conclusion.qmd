## Closing the Research Gap

Rehash intro and motivation and then summarise how each chapter links to the research gaps/questions/objectives.

Overstories of needleleaf forests have an important control on the partitioning of precipitation to the ground or back to the atmosphere and the phase of precipitation reaching the ground. In cold climate forests, around half of annual snowfall may be lost to the atmosphere via canopy snow sublimation and in temperate-maritime forests increased energy incident on snow intercepted in the canopy can result in increased snowmelt rates and decreased subcanopy snow accumulation. However, sparse observations of canopy snow processes and forest snow accumulation has led to limited testing of these theories leading to uncertain application when applied in hydrological models across the globe. This uncertainty contributes to uncertain estimates of land-surface albedo, snow accumulation, and subsequent streamflow simulations. Moreover, as the global climate warms there is a need to ensure existing theories to represent snow interception processes are robust across a range of meteorological conditions. The primary goal this research aimed to address was to first investigate the theories and assumptions underpinning current forest snow accumulation models and determine if existing theories are supported by in-situ observations collected from a needleleaf subalpine forest. 

Forest-snow processes that are represented in hydrological models to simulate forest snow accumulation including initial interception in the canopy, and subsequent ablation through mass unloading, melt, and sublimation occur simultaneously are are difficult to isolate in observations. This measurement difficulty has resulted in parameterisations that combine several processes (i.e., initial interception with unloading or wind-driven unloading with sublimation losses). This mixing of processes in measurements and resulting parameterisations introduces potential double counting of processes in hydrological models. To better evaluate process representation the observations collected in this study focused on isolating individual processes in the canopy snow mass balance in an effort to both evaluate the assumptions underlying existing models and develop new parameterisations that are isolated to a single process. 

Specifically, high-temporal frequency lysimeter measurements at a point were utilized to isolate observations of initial canopy snow load before unloading and showed that significantly higher canopy snow accumulations were observed than predicted by previous approaches. High-spatial resolution measurements of subcanopy throughfall corroborated with the point-scale measurements where initial interception was not found to decline significantly with increasing canopy snow load — a key theory behind many previous interception models. Although canopy snow ablation measurements are more difficult to obtain over space, point measurements from the lysimeters found the predictors important in the unloading process were similar to existing studies including, canopy snow load, canopy snow melt, and wind speed. However, relationships to represent each of these unloading relationships were found to differ greatly from existing approaches and suggests that ablation of canopy snow through existing canopy snow unloading parameterations may be in error especially if combined with an initial canopy snow interception parameterisation that is based on a maximim canopy snow load capacity. The new interception and ablation relationships presented here had improved representation of canopy snow load when evaluated against measurements from a weighed tree lysimter compared to traditional approaches. These new relationships were incorporated as a new module in CRHM to facilitate falsification tests of these new parameterisation at four diverse forested mountain research basins. Since direct measurements of canopy snow processes such as initial interception and ablation are not commonly measured at hydrometerological stations, and was not feasible to conduct in a high quality manor as part of this PhD research, the new CRHM modules were assessed on the more commonly available forest snow survey. CRHM was setup using the updated and existing modules at the model development site (Fortress Mountain) and three other research basins encompassing a range of climates and forest species including Wolf Creek (Yukon Territory), Russell Creek (Vancouver Island, British Columbia), and Marmot Creek (Kananaskis, Alberta). In additional to evaluating the two modules on forest SWE accumulation, a model process diagnosis was conducted to determine why the new and existing approaches produce differing results. 

The main findings from each of the thesis chapter are summarised below:

### Research Question 1.1: Review Paper (Chapter 2)

- Describes the theories and assumptions underpinning existing snow interception and canopy snow ablation parameterisations.

- The applicability of existing methods and current research gaps are elucidated. 

- The differing process behaviour and number of processes included in existing forest snow accumulation models is typically equated to differing environmental conditions in previous studies. However, this work outlines that existing uncertainties in measurements also likely contributes to the differing process behaviour. 

- Existing initial snow interception parameterisations were developed using measurements that were not isolated from ablation processes and therefore have uncertain applicability when combined with additional ablation parameterisations.

- Canopy snow unloading measurements are shown to be difficult to collect across the literature and has led to limited and sparse measurements. As a result, current canopy snow unloading parameterisations are based on indirect measurements of canopy snow unloading from above canopy albedo [e.g., @Roesch2001] which may also incorporate sublimation losses. Thus, to address this research gap additional direct measurements of canopy snow unloading are needed. 

- This study also helped identify the gaps in the literature to justify conducting the following thesis chapters such as isolating interception vs ablation processes.

- Previous snow interception parameterizations were developed on relatively small spacial scales (point to, transect) and over longer time periods by some studies (weeks).

### Research Question 1.2: Initial Interception Process (Chapter 3)

- This research showed that existing theories of a maximum canopy snow load capacity were not applicable at this study site and are more likely due to previous studies including unloading within the interception measurements. 
- Branch bending related to both air temperature and canopy snow load was hypothesized to balance out increases in contact area as snow bridged gaps in the canopy while the horizontal areal coverage of the canopy declined as branches bend. This process was also hypothesized to contribute to the limited influence of air temperature on interception efficiency as snow becomes stickier, branches also bend easier and reduced the leaf contact area.
- Interception efficiency, before ablation was found to be most strongly related to leaf-contact area which is also moderated by hydrometeor trajectory angle. An existing relationship to describe the change in leaf-contact area with hydrometeor trajectory angle failed to represent observations collected in this study.
- Based on the invalidation of the assumptions of previous interception theroies of maxoimum canopy snow load, air temperature influence, and new relationship between leaf contact area and hydrometeor trajectory angle two new parameterisations are presented. First leaf contact area is shown to be approximated from estimated hydrometeor trajectory angle and nadir canopy cover. Second, similar to some rainfall interception parameterisations initial interception is calculated as a function of snowfall and leaf contact area and a efficiency parameter.
- By dedicating interception parameterisations to a single process they are more compatible with additional paramaterisations and better integrate into modular hydrological model platforms [e.g., @Pomeroy2022; @Clark2015b]

### Research Question 1.3: Canopy Snow Ablation Processes (Chapter 4)

- Direct measurements of canopy snow unloading were collected to test existing theories of unloading. Although collected at a single site, the canopy snow unloading measurements presented here were collected over events with meteorological conditions representative of climates ranging from the cold boreal forest to temperate maritime. 
- These observations were generally in agreement with existing theories and showed increasing unloading with canopy snow load, wind, and canopy snow melt rate. However, the relationships to represent these individual processes differed from previous studies. This study showed that improved representation of unloading due to wind could be predicted by shear stress compared to previous studies that used a linear function of wind speed as a predictor [@Roesch2001; @Bartlett2015]. Moreover, while canopy snow unloading has previously been shown to increase linearly with the canopy snow melt rate at a constant rate of 0.4 [@Storck2002] the results from this study showed increased unloading of solid snow clumps with increasing canopy snow load.
- Existing unloading parameterisations for wind were developed on above canopy albedo measurements which are also influenced by the sublimation process. This may explain the overestimation of unloading by the @Roesch2001 parameterisation compared to the relationship developed at this study site.
- The rate of unloading and drip predicted by the air temperature dependent parameterisations was found to far underestimate observed canopy snow ablation from the weighed tree. The energy balance based-approach better approximated the rate of unloading + drip, and suggests the benefits of physically-based representations of the energy balance to simulate ablation for snowmelt periods. 
- Little difference was found between the performance of an analytical canopy snow sublimation routine [@Pomeroy1998b] compared to an iterative energy balance-based routine from [@Essery2003].
- Weighed tree observations showed that a maximum canopy snow load was not observed over our study period and the canopy snow loads measured were much higher than existing theories of maximum canopy snow load predicted. 
- Existing methods using temperature index-based canopy snowmelt had much larger error in simulating canopy snow load for warm and humid events compared to energy balance-based approaches.
- All canopy snow models had the highest error in simulating canopy snow load for cold and dry events
- The partitioning of canopy snow was shown to be most sensitive for cold events, with models that neglect dry snow unloading returning all canopy snow back to the atmosphere via sublimation. 

### Research Question 2.1: Model Evaluation (Chapter 5)

- This paper utilises forest SWE observations collected at four research basins located in western Canada which consist of diverse forest species, forest structure, and climates to evaluate simulated forest SWE using a novel and existing canopy snow model. Snow interception models have been tested at relatively few locations and thus this study presents an important contribution in testing models at additional locations. It also provides the validation of the new snow interception model—initial developed at Fortress Mountain—at locations in which it was not developed. While improved process representation by the new model was shown in Chapter 4 at one site, this Chapter builds on this and tests the process representation at three additional diverse sites.
- The updated model saw relatively similar performance at Fortress, Marmot, and Wolf Creek compared to the existing model. However, substantial improvement was found on the coastal-warm-humid Russell Creek site due to the misrepresentation of the canopy snowmelt/drip/unloading process in the existing model. 
- Although both models show good performance at Fortress, Marmot and Wolf Creek there is a large difference in the fraction of intercepted snow that is sublimated, particularly for Marmot where 10% more snowfall was sublimated for the new model compared to the old one due to higher unloading rates in the old model

## Advancing Forest Snow Accumulation Models

How does this work push the discipline forward?

- Existing canopy snow interception parameterisations were shown to achieve the right answer for the wrong reason and may contribute to the lack of transferability of existing approaches to new sites. 
- The new proposed equations here better represent individual forest-snow processes and are likely to achieve better transferability across differing sites and future climates.
- Existing approaches significantly under estimate the amount of snow intercepted in the canopy canopy due to some inclusion of the unloading process in the initial interception process. The updated parameterisations presented in this thesis more accurately represent the amount of snow intercepted in the canopy and also the subsequent ablation processes resulting in a more comprehensive and transferable approach. 
- Better modularity in canopy snow processes
- additional testing of models at 4 very diverse sites
- Careful quality field measurements as emphasized by @Lundquist2021 were a crucial component of this research. While much can be learned by analying end-member measurements (e.g., streamflow, snow accumulation) many significant advancements in the field of hydrology stem from individual process diagnoses to better improve process representations as parameterisations in hydrological models [e.g., @Pomeroy1993; @Aubry-Wake2023; @Rutter1971; @Harder2016]. The resulting parameterisations are only as good as the input data and thus is a cruical component of this process. In this thesis great care was taken in collecting careful observations of hydrometeorological variables and eneables the level of detail conducted in this research. Where possible in the first two years of this research field visits to Fortress mountain were conducted prior to and following individual snowfall events resulting in weekly to bi-weekly visits but up to twice per week. This high frequency of visits helped ensure instruments were operational (i.e., not snow covered, identify wires chewed up by animals) in addition to the high frequency of field visits four time-lapse cameras helped fill in the gaps between field visits to confirm operational instrumentation (anemometer snow covered) and/or process diagnosis for determining periods of canopy snow unloading, and distinguishing drip from melt processes. 
- This thesis work also builds on several previous important studies, notably @Staines2023 who developed a sophisticated software to aid the LiDAR data processing conducted as part of Chapter 2 of this thesis. Building on the work by @Staines2023 in addition to incorporating other novel methodologies suggested by colleuges at the Hakai Institute to incorporate bias correction on the LiDAR point clouds to account for IMU drift enabled the sub-centemetre precision necessary to utilize this lidar data to measure event-based throughfall. 
- These careful process level diagnosis field-based measurements have been documented throughout the thesis chapters and provide a template for future similar process studies in other environments. 

## Future Directions

- investigate I/P efficiency parameter
- need additional measurements of canopy snow unloading and drip
- adhesion/cohesion of intercepted snow remains uncertain
- no obs for max canopy snow load
- rime-ice adhesion study
- While not the focus of this study, parameterisations involved in both the initial interception and subsequent ablation processes are expected to differ across various sites. Despite this satisfactory model performance was acheived using the baseline parameters developed at Fortress, future work could help determine ranges of appropriate parameters for different locations with differing forest species, forest structure, and climates. Specific parameterise which likely require site specific calibration include: the interception efficiency parameter (may be lower for some species i.e., hemlock, cedar, deciduous or higher for climates with increased precipitation near the melting point), parameters for wind-induced and melt-induced unloading are likely also site specific and relate to several factors (i.e., tree species, forest structure, climate), several parameters are also used to help with approximations in the energy balance of canopy snow as well.
