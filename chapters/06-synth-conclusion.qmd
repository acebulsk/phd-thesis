## Closing the Research Gap

Rehash intro and motivation and then summarise how each chapter links to the research gaps/questions/objectives.

Needleleaf forests have an important control on the partitioning the fraction and the phase of precipitation reaching the ground. In cold climate forests, around half of annual snowfall may be lost to the atmosphere via canopy snow sublimation and in warmer climates increased melt rates increases the liquid fraction of precipitation reaching the ground. However, sparse observations of canopy snow processes and forest snow accumulation has led to limited testing of these theories leading to uncertain application when applied in hydrological models across the globe. This uncertainty contributes to limited or uncertain process diagnosis and prediction of land-surface albedo, snow accumulation, and subsequent water resources in forested cold regions environments. Moreover, as the global climate warms there is a need to ensure existing theories to represent snow interception processes are robust across a range of meteorological conditions and forest types. The primary goal this research aimed to address was to first investigate the theories and assumptions underpinning current forest snow accumulation models and determine if existing theories are supported by in-situ observations collected from a needleleaf subalpine forest. This approach helped identify where existing approaches were most uncertain and then aimed to propose solutions to improve model accuracy. Overall this thesis aims to bridge the gap between developments in process understanding through field-based observations to implementation and validation in models.

In Chapter 2 a comprehensive literature review is presented to establish major gaps in the literature. In this review the theories and assumptions underpinning existing snow interception and canopy snow ablation parameterisations are presented addressing Research Question 1 of Objective 1. Several differing approaches for representing forest-snow interactions were identified in this review. Although the decision to implement certain approaches was typically over simplified with one approach being best for "sticky" versus "dry" snow it was also revealed that there has been little consideration for thier transferability in more diverse envrionements such as sparse or discontinuous canopies and meteorological conditions such as warm, humid, cold, windy or differing combinations. The differing process behaviour and number of processes included in existing forest snow accumulation models is typically equated to differing environmental conditions in previous studies. However, this work outlines that existing uncertainties in measurements also likely contributes to the differing process behaviour. Existing initial snow interception parameterisations were developed using measurements that were not isolated from ablation processes and therefore have uncertain applicability when combined with additional ablation parameterisations. This mixing of processes in measurements and resulting parameterisations introduces potential double counting of processes in hydrological models. Canopy snow unloading measurements are shown to be difficult to collect across the literature and has led to limited and sparse measurements. As a result, current canopy snow unloading parameterisations are based on indirect measurements of canopy snow unloading from above canopy albedo [e.g., @Roesch2001] which may also incorporate sublimation losses. Moreover, many previous studies have noted challenges in isolating individual canopy snow ablation processes resulting in difficulties differenciating between ablation of canopy snow as solid (unloading) and liquid (drip) during unloading. Thus, to address this research gap additional direct measurements of canopy snow unloading are needed and hybrid approaches to help differentiate processes where they cannot be measured using the best information available. It was also identified that previous snow interception parameterizations were developed on relatively small spacial scales (point to, transect) and over longer time periods by some studies (weeks). Therefore, there it was determined there is a need for additional observations of forest-snow interactions that traverse multiple temporal and spatial scales. To better evaluate process representation the observations collected in this study focused on isolating individual processes in the canopy snow mass balance in an effort to both evaluate the assumptions underlying existing models and develop new parameterisations that are isolated to a single process.

Chapter 3 aimed to address several research gaps regarding process understanding of initial accumulation of snow in the canopy. Specifically, several existing snow interception parameterisations increase throughfall of snow with increasing canopy snow loads and air temperature. Moreover, exisitng relationships have largely been developed in dense forest canopies and therefore this study aimed to investigate the relationship of initial snow interception across a wide range of canopy coverages. To determine if this relationship is due to alterations in canopy density resulting from branch bending or increases in canopy snow unloading, new observations were collected which limited the inclusion of canopy snow ablation processes. To facilitate this 15-minute interval measurements of throughfall were carefully currated using time-lapse imagery, and threshold checks (to ensure throughfall + unloading was less than the snowfall rate) ensuring that these mesurements limited their inclusion of canopy snow ablation. This research showed that existing theories of a maximum canopy snow load capacity and air temperature on initial interception were not applicable at this study site and are more likely due to previous studies including unloading within the interception measurements. Branch bending related to both air temperature and canopy snow load was hypothesized to balance out increases in contact area as snow bridged gaps in the canopy while the horizontal areal coverage of the canopy declined as branches bend. This process was also hypothesized to contribute to the limited influence of air temperature on interception efficiency as snow becomes stickier, branches also bend easier and reduced the leaf contact area. A canopy density metric that takes into account the influence of snowfall trajectory on the number of snow-leaf area contacts emerged as the best predictor of initial interception and can be approximated using only wind speed, canopy coverage, and hydrometeor velocity. Incorporating this snowfall vector-based canopy density metric improved the prediction in a diverse canopy across a broad range in canopy densities providing confidence in this parameterisation across a broad range of canopy structures.

- Interception efficiency, before ablation was found to be most strongly related to leaf-contact area which is also moderated by hydrometeor trajectory angle. An existing relationship to describe the change in leaf-contact area with hydrometeor trajectory angle failed to represent observations collected in this study.
- Based on the invalidation of the assumptions of previous interception theroies of maxoimum canopy snow load, air temperature influence, and new relationship between leaf contact area and hydrometeor trajectory angle two new parameterisations are presented. First leaf contact area is shown to be approximated from estimated hydrometeor trajectory angle and nadir canopy cover. Second, similar to some rainfall interception parameterisations initial interception is calculated as a function of snowfall and leaf contact area and a efficiency parameter.
- By dedicating interception parameterisations to a single process they are more compatible with additional paramaterisations and better integrate into modular hydrological model platforms [e.g., @Pomeroy2022; @Clark2015b]

In Chapter 4 carefully collected lysimetry provided new insights on the canopy snow unloading and melt processes. Based on direct measurements of canopy snow unloading, canopy snow load, wind shear stress, and the canopy snowmelt rate emerged as primary predictors of canopy snow unloading. These findings corroborate with several existing studies suggesting the importance of both cold/dry and melt-induced unloading, however the observed relationships differed in terms of the exact predictor variables used to represent both types of unloading. For example, both wind-shear stress showed improved predictibility over wind speed alone and likely relates to its improved physical basis. Moreover, while temperature index models have showed some sucess in representing melt-induced unloading of snow intercepted in the canopy they showed drastically reduced performance compared to a physically based energy balance canopy snowmelt routine. These findings highlight the importance of providing a comprehensive representation of both dry and melt-induced unloading as well as more physically based methods (wind shear stress instead of wind speed, energy balance based snowmelt vs temperature index methods). Moreover, a new relationship was found showing the amount of solid snow unloading during canopy snowmelt increased linearly with canopy snow load. Since existing canopy snow unloading routines were developed considering initial accumulation routines which also included unloading the relationships presented here are thought to be more compatible with routines that only calculate unloading. 

- Although canopy snow ablation measurements are more difficult to obtain over space, point measurements from the lysimeters found the predictors important in the unloading process were similar to existing studies including, canopy snow load, canopy snow melt, and wind speed. However, relationships to represent each of these unloading relationships were found to differ greatly from existing approaches and suggests that ablation of canopy snow through existing canopy snow unloading parameterations may be in error especially if combined with an initial canopy snow interception parameterisation that is based on a maximim canopy snow load capacity.

- Direct measurements of canopy snow unloading were collected to test existing theories of unloading. Although collected at a single site, the canopy snow unloading measurements presented here were collected over events with meteorological conditions representative of climates ranging from the cold boreal forest to temperate maritime. 
- These observations were generally in agreement with existing theories and showed increasing unloading with canopy snow load, wind, and canopy snow melt rate. However, the relationships to represent these individual processes differed from previous studies. This study showed that improved representation of unloading due to wind could be predicted by shear stress compared to previous studies that used a linear function of wind speed as a predictor [@Roesch2001; @Bartlett2015]. Moreover, while canopy snow unloading has previously been shown to increase linearly with the canopy snow melt rate at a constant rate of 0.4 [@Storck2002] the results from this study showed increased unloading of solid snow clumps with increasing canopy snow load.
- Existing unloading parameterisations for wind were developed on above canopy albedo measurements which are also influenced by the sublimation process. This may explain the overestimation of unloading by the @Roesch2001 parameterisation compared to the relationship developed at this study site.
- The rate of unloading and drip predicted by the air temperature dependent parameterisations was found to far underestimate observed canopy snow ablation from the weighed tree. The energy balance based-approach better approximated the rate of unloading + drip, and suggests the benefits of physically-based representations of the energy balance to simulate ablation for snowmelt periods. 
- Little difference was found between the performance of an analytical canopy snow sublimation routine [@Pomeroy1998b] compared to an iterative energy balance-based routine from [@Essery2003].
- Weighed tree observations showed that a maximum canopy snow load was not observed over our study period and the canopy snow loads measured were much higher than existing theories of maximum canopy snow load predicted. 
- Existing methods using temperature index-based canopy snowmelt had much larger error in simulating canopy snow load for warm and humid events compared to energy balance-based approaches.
- All canopy snow models had the highest error in simulating canopy snow load for cold and dry events
- The partitioning of canopy snow was shown to be most sensitive for cold events, with models that neglect dry snow unloading returning all canopy snow back to the atmosphere via sublimation. 

In Chapter 5 a new model to represent the mass and energy balance of snow intercepted in the canopy is presented which aims to address limitations of previous approaches identified in this study. The main goal of this new model is to be flexible with individual processes represented by individual parameterisations, contrasting with existing approaches which combined multiple processes within signle parameterisations and limited the modularity of hydrological models. Moreover, the missing procesess identified in this work suggest existing estimates of forest-snow intercactions, with implications for water resources and land-surface energy exchanges may be in error if outside of regions these exxsiting parameterisations were developed and or calibrated. The results presented here suggest improved transferability of forest-snow interaction models across diverse canopy structures and climates. Moreover, the flexible modular nature of the model should enable easier implementation of new canopy snow interception ablation routines as they are further developed based on new observations or parameters adjusted using machine learning models.

- The new interception and ablation relationships presented here had improved representation of canopy snow load when evaluated against measurements from a weighed tree lysimter compared to traditional approaches. These new relationships were incorporated as a new module in CRHM to facilitate falsification tests of these new parameterisation at four diverse forested mountain research basins. Since direct measurements of canopy snow processes such as initial interception and ablation are not commonly measured at hydrometerological stations, and was not feasible to conduct in a high quality manor as part of this PhD research, the new CRHM modules were assessed on the more commonly available forest snow survey. CRHM was setup using the updated and existing modules at the model development site (Fortress Mountain) and three other research basins encompassing a range of climates and forest species including Wolf Creek (Yukon Territory), Russell Creek (Vancouver Island, British Columbia), and Marmot Creek (Kananaskis, Alberta). In additional to evaluating the two modules on forest SWE accumulation, a model process diagnosis was conducted to determine why the new and existing approaches produce differing results. 

- This paper utilises forest SWE observations collected at four research basins located in western Canada which consist of diverse forest species, forest structure, and climates to evaluate simulated forest SWE using a novel and existing canopy snow model. Snow interception models have been tested at relatively few locations and thus this study presents an important contribution in testing models at additional locations. It also provides the validation of the new snow interception model—initial developed at Fortress Mountain—at locations in which it was not developed. While improved process representation by the new model was shown in Chapter 4 at one site, this Chapter builds on this and tests the process representation at three additional diverse sites.
- The updated model saw relatively similar performance at Fortress, Marmot, and Wolf Creek compared to the existing model. However, substantial improvement was found on the coastal-warm-humid Russell Creek site due to the misrepresentation of the canopy snowmelt/drip/unloading process in the existing model. 
- Although both models show good performance at Fortress, Marmot and Wolf Creek there is a large difference in the fraction of intercepted snow that is sublimated, particularly for Marmot where 10% more snowfall was sublimated for the new model compared to the old one due to higher unloading rates in the old model

## Advancing Forest Snow Accumulation Models

How does this work push the discipline forward?

- Existing canopy snow interception parameterisations were shown to achieve the right answer for the wrong reason and may contribute to the lack of transferability of existing approaches to new sites. 
- The new proposed equations here better represent individual forest-snow processes and are likely to achieve better transferability across differing sites and future climates.
- Existing approaches significantly under estimate the amount of snow intercepted in the canopy canopy due to some inclusion of the unloading process in the initial interception process. The updated parameterisations presented in this thesis more accurately represent the amount of snow intercepted in the canopy and also the subsequent ablation processes resulting in a more comprehensive and transferable approach. 
- Better modularity in canopy snow processes
- additional testing of models at 4 very diverse sites
- Careful quality field measurements as emphasized by @Lundquist2021 were a crucial component of this research. While much can be learned by analying end-member measurements (e.g., streamflow, snow accumulation) many significant advancements in the field of hydrology stem from individual process diagnoses to better improve process representations as parameterisations in hydrological models [e.g., @Pomeroy1993; @Aubry-Wake2023; @Rutter1971; @Harder2016]. The resulting parameterisations are only as good as the input data and thus is a cruical component of this process. In this thesis great care was taken in collecting careful observations of hydrometeorological variables and eneables the level of detail conducted in this research. Where possible in the first two years of this research field visits to Fortress mountain were conducted prior to and following individual snowfall events resulting in weekly to bi-weekly visits but up to twice per week. This high frequency of visits helped ensure instruments were operational (i.e., not snow covered, identify wires chewed up by animals) in addition to the high frequency of field visits four time-lapse cameras helped fill in the gaps between field visits to confirm operational instrumentation (anemometer snow covered) and/or process diagnosis for determining periods of canopy snow unloading, and distinguishing drip from melt processes. 
- This thesis work also builds on several previous important studies, notably @Staines2023 who developed a sophisticated software to aid the LiDAR data processing conducted as part of Chapter 2 of this thesis. Building on the work by @Staines2023 in addition to incorporating other novel methodologies suggested by colleuges at the Hakai Institute to incorporate bias correction on the LiDAR point clouds to account for IMU drift enabled the sub-centemetre precision necessary to utilize this lidar data to measure event-based throughfall. 
- These careful process level diagnosis field-based measurements have been documented throughout the thesis chapters and provide a template for future similar process studies in other environments. 
- Improves understanding of empirical coefficients which previously represented multiple processes (i.e., species holding capacity and unloading coefficients were controlling the same process)
- Provides a model to diagnose the influence of global change on snow hydrology in forested cold regions with implications for broader land surface schemes as well. 
- As regimes shift from cold sublimation dominated canopy snow processes to warmer climate conditions an increase in warm-melt induced processes is expected with implications on the quantity and timing of snow accumulation in forests across Canada. 

## Future Directions

- investigate I/P efficiency parameter
- need additional measurements of canopy snow unloading and drip
- adhesion/cohesion of intercepted snow remains uncertain
- no obs for max canopy snow load
- rime-ice adhesion study
- refreezing of snow in the canopy having reduced ablation rates maybe closer to ice
- While not the focus of this study, parameterisations involved in both the initial interception and subsequent ablation processes are expected to differ across various sites. Despite this satisfactory model performance was acheived using the baseline parameters developed at Fortress, future work could help determine ranges of appropriate parameters for different locations with differing forest species, forest structure, and climates. Specific parameterise which likely require site specific calibration include: the interception efficiency parameter (may be lower for some species i.e., hemlock, cedar, deciduous or higher for climates with increased precipitation near the melting point), parameters for wind-induced and melt-induced unloading are likely also site specific and relate to several factors (i.e., tree species, forest structure, climate), several parameters are also used to help with approximations in the energy balance of canopy snow as well. 
- changing forest snow partitioning regimes from sublimation to melt dominated in a future climate 

The main philosophical argument that this thesis presents is that computational approximations of hydrological processes should represent individual dominant processes where possible. This allows for improved process diagnosis and compatibility amongst differing parameterisations. Alternatively parameterisations that represent differing degrees of different processes hinder the mixing and matching facilitated by hydrological model platforms.
