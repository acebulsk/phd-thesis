## Abstract

## Introduction

Snow is an important water resource, directly supporting over two billion people globally [@Immerzeel2020; @Viviroli2020], while also affecting earths energy balance via surface albedo [@Thackeray2014; @Wang2016] and stream temperatures [e.g., @Leach2014]. However, snowpacks are increasingly threatened due to changes in both climate and vegetation cover worldwide [@Lopez-Moreno2014; @Immerzeel2020; @Viviroli2020]. In cold-dry climates, sublimation of snow intercepted by forest canopies can return up to 45% of seasonal snowfall back to the atmosphere [@Essery2003; @Sanmiguel-Vallelado2017], whereas in temperate-maritime climates sublimation is less prevalent and a large fraction of snowfall melts in the canopy [@Storck2002]. Hydrological models are essential tools for understanding how climate and vegetation influence snow processes and downstream water resources, and their accuracy depends on accurate representations of forest-snow processes. Yet, uncertainties in forest-snow process representation lead to variable transferability across climates and forest types when simulating subcanopy snow water equivalent (SWE) [@Essery2003; @Gelfan2004; @Rutter2009; @Krinner2018] and diagnosing snow processes [@Lundquist2021; @Lumbrazo2022]. This variability is compounded by the strong dependence of snow partitioning by vegetation on meteorology and canopy density which has challenged earlier canopy snow parameterisations that have been tested and developed on sparse observations [@Lundquist2021]. Over half of the Northern Hemisphere experiences snowfall in forested areas [@Kim2017] and over 23% of land mass globally [@Deschamps-Berger2025], spanning diverse climates and forest structures, highlighting the need for robust models, transferable models. While simulation of SWE in forests remains challenging it is a crucial aspect to understand the impacts of climate and land cover changes on water resources in many cold regions across the globe. 

Recent studies have advanced understanding of the canopy snow energy and mass balance [@Lundquist2021; @Lumbrazo2022; @Cebulski2025a; @Cebulski2025b], with potential to improve SWE simulations in forested basins. For example, @Lundquist2021 demonstrated that calculating throughfall as a function of antecedent snow load can overestimate snow reaching the ground—when also combined with a comprehensive canopy snow unloading routine. Building on this, @Staines2023 and @Cebulski2025a showed that initial interception can predicted as a function of canopy density without assuming maximum canopy snow load. Moreover, @Roesch2001 and @Lumbrazo2022 show the importance of representing both wind and melt-induced unloading for representing canopy snow ablation. A new physically-based canopy snow mass and energy balance presented in @Cebulski2025b provided improved representation of canopy snow ablation compared to previous approaches that were either missing key processes [i.e., dry snow unloading in @Andreadis2009] or based on empirical relationships [i.e., ice-bulb temperature induced melt unloading and drip in @Ellis2010]. These advances have been implemented as new parameterisations in the Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling Platform to answer the following research questions:

1. What is the performance of a novel hydrological model in simulating the accumulation of subcanopy SWE in forested environments characterized by varying tree species, canopy structures, and meteorological conditions?
2. How does the performance of the new model in simulating SWE compare to that of a conventional modelling approach across differing environments?
3. What are the canopy snow processes that account for the differences in SWE between the modelling approaches and how do these differ with climate and forest structural differences?

The objective of this research is to evaluate new snow interception and ablation parameterizations for simulating subcanopy SWE and diagnosing causative processes in needleleaf forests. Evaluation of the new model in simulating initial accumulation of snow in the canopy has been addressed in @Cebulski2025a and canopy snow ablation in @Cebulski2025b.

## Methods

### Study Sites

The needleleaf snowpack models were evaluated at four locations in western Canada spanning a range of climate and forest types (@fig-map; @tbl-site-meta). The model simulation years for each site are shown in @tbl-site-meta and were selected based on the availability of bi-weekly to monthly subcanopy SWE measurements and hourly station-based observations of air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, total precipitation, and net solar radiation adjacent to the snow survey transects. At each site, snow surveys consisted of snow depth measurements at all locations and snow density measurements at one out of every five locations. SWE was calculated from snow depth and snow density following the methods outlined in @Pomeroy1995. The four study sites include:

Wolf Creek Research Basin - Forest Site (60.60, -134.96, 750 m asl.) is located 16 km south of Whitehorse, Yukon Territory in a level dense forest with a sub-arctic climate [see basin scale location in Fig. 1 in @Rasouli2019]. Snow surveys were conducted along a transect that traverses through mature forest consisting of primarily White spruce and Lodgepole pine. Additional details on the snow survey and meteorological measurements is described in @Rasouli2019 and @Pomeroy2025. 
  
Russell Creek Experimental Watershed - Upper Stephanie Old Growth Site (50.32, -126.35, 700 m asl.) is located on northern Vancouver Island, British Columbia with a temperate-maritime climate that receives substantial winter precipitation. Snow survey transects were conducted in cardinal directions within a mature old growth forest that consists of Amabilis fir and Western hemlock [@Floyd2012]. Additional details on the snow survey and meteorological instrumentation are provided in @Floyd2012. Total precipitation data were unavailable at the Russell site for the 2008 water year. For this period, records from the Tsitika Summit station (50.28°N, 126.36°W; 450 m asl.), operated by the British Columbia Ministry of Transport and located 5 km from Russell, were used instead.
  
Fortress Mountain Research Basin - Powerline site (50.83, -115.20, 2100 m asl., Kananaskis, Alberta) is located on a wind-exposed subalpine ridge top covered with sparse forest with a continental climate [see basin scale location in Fig. X in @Pomeroy2025]. The vegetation at this site consists of coexisting Subalpine fir and Engelmann spruce tree species [@Langs2020]. Snow survey measurements of snow depth and density were collected following a transect through mature forest east of the Powerline meteorological tower [see Fig. 1 in @Cebulski2025a] and described in further detail in @Pomeroy2025. The meteorological forcing data used in this study is described in detail in @Cebulski2025b.

Marmot Creek Research Basin - Upper Forest site (50.93, -115.16, 1848 m asl., Kananaskis, Alberta) is located on a dense forested plateau with a continental climate 14 km north of Fortress but receives much less precipitation [see basin scale location in Fig. 1 in @Fang2019]. Vegetation consisted primarily of Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, and lodgepole pine [@Fang2019; @Staines2023]. Snow surveys were conducted following a cardinal transect through mature forest surrounding the "Upper Clearing" meteorological tower [see Fig. 1b in @Staines2023] and described in further detail in @Pomeroy2025. The meteorological forcing data and corresponding instrumentation used from this site is described in @Fang2019 and @Pomeroy2025.

### Simulation of Subcanopy Snowpack

The Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling Platform (CRHM) was implemented to simulate SWE at each of the four forest plots. The CRHM platform is described in detail in @Pomeroy2022; and the up-to-date source code is available at <://github.com/srlabUsask/crhmcode>. Hourly climate forcing data from station-based measurements of air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, total precipitation, and above canopy incoming solar radiation were used to run the CRHM models. Incoming solar radiation observations were not available for Wolf Creek and were simulated following theoretical clear-sky radiation by @Garnier1970 and atmospheric transmittance by @Annandale2002 and @Shook2011. 

Atmospheric precipitation was partitioned into snow and/or rain phases following the psychometric energy balance approach of @Harder2013 which accounts for the influence of temperature and humidity on precipitation phase. The interaction of incoming precipitation with the forest canopy was treated using two different approaches. An updated approach following new relationships presented in @Cebulski2025a and @Cebulski2025b (CP25) to represent the canopy snow energy and mass balance were integrated within CRHM. This new approach simulates initial interception of snow in the canopy as a function of canopy density [@Cebulski2025a] and subsequent ablation of snow intercepted in the canopy by melt and dry-snow unloading [@Cebulski2025b], energy balance-based snowmelt [@Cebulski2025b], and energy balance-based sublimation [@Essery2003]. A second approach (E10) which is based on observations by @Hedstrom1998, @Pomeroy1998b, and @Floyd2012; and implemented as described in @Ellis2010. E10 calculates initial interception of snow in the canopy as a function of canopy density, antecedent snow load, and a species dependent storage capacity following @Hedstrom1998. Ablation of snow intercepted in the canopy is determined by dry snow unloading [function of canopy snow load as in @Hedstrom1998], unloading due to melt [@Ellis2010], canopy snowmelt drainage [threshold function of ice-bulb temperature as in @Ellis2010], and sublimation by an analytical energy balance-based parameterisation [@Pomeroy1998b]. See @Cebulski2025 for a complete description of the E10 parameterisation. While neither the E10 nor CP25 model was calibrated for this study, their parameterisations were originally developed using data from Marmot and Fortress, respectively.

A two-layer energy and mass balance snowmelt model [Snobal, @Marks1998] was used to calculate subcanopy snowpack processes. Net shortwave radiation to the subcanopy snowpack was simulated by calculating the transmittance of irradiance through the canopy, less the amount reflected from the snow surface [@Pomeroy2009; @Ellis2010]. Incoming longwave radiation to subcanopy snow was simulated by thermal emissions from the atmosphere and vegetation elements, weighted by sky-view-factor [@Ellis2010; @Pomeroy2009]. Sensible and latent heat fluxes to the subcanopy snowpack were determined using an approach adopted from @Brutsaert1982 and @Marks1992 and is described in the CRHM source code. Only two water years were simulated at Russell due to limited model forcing and validation data.

### Model Evaluation

Simulated subcanopy SWE by the two models (E10 and CP25) was evaluated using snow survey observations collected from transects at the four forest plots. The performance of the two models was evaluated based on the differences in simulated ($S_i$) and observed ($O_i$) values of SWE using mean bias (MB) and root mean squared error (RMSE) as:

$$
\text{MB} = \frac{1}{n} \sum^n_{i=1}(S_i-O_i)
$$ {#eq-mb}

and

$$
\text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum^n_{i=1}(S_i-O_i)^2}{n}}
$$ {#eq-rmse}

Values for $S_i$ were selected for each site from the E10 and CP25 CRHM simulated SWE state for the timestamp that matched each of the snow survey observations ($O_i$). The MB and RMSE statistics represent the model performance over all simulation years for each site.

## Results 

### Snowpack Observations 

Amongst the sites and years included in the study, accumulation of snowfall below the canopy was less than cumulative snowfall, as observed in open clearings adjacent to each forest transect (@fig-sf-subcpy-swe). At peak seasonal subcanopy SWE, Fortress had the highest fraction of seasonal snowfall stored in the subcanopy snowpack at `r frac_sf_as_pk_swe_lst[["Fortress - Powerline Forest"]]`, followed by Marmot and Wolf Creek which both had similar fractions at `r frac_sf_as_pk_swe_lst[["Wolf Creek - Forest"]]`, and Russell had the smallest fraction at `r frac_sf_as_pk_swe_lst[["Russell - Old Growth"]]` when averaged over all years. Variations in the prevalence of canopy snow unloading, melt/drip, and sublimation contributed to the observed differences in subcanopy snow accumulation relative to the open clearings at each site. At the temperate-maritime Russell site mid-winter melt events also contributed to these observed differences. Following validation of the new CP25 model in representing subcanopy SWE, a diagnosis on the contribution of each canopy snow processes in influencing subcanopy snowfall accumulation will be conducted in @sec-sf-partition for each site. 

![Time series showing seasonal cumulative snowfall (black lines) and subcanopy snow water equivalent from in situ snow surveys (red dots). Note: snowfall was determined from observed total precipitation for each site using the snowfall fraction simulated in CRHM following @Harder2013.](figs/figure3_a.png){#fig-sf-subcpy-swe}

Observed subcanopy SWE varied from a seasonal mean of `r obs_swe_stats$min_mean_swe |> round(1)` to `r obs_swe_stats$max_mean_swe |> round(1)` kg m^-2^ (@fig-swe-ann-mean) and seasonal peak SWE varied from `r obs_swe_stats$min_peak_swe |> round(1)` to `r obs_swe_stats$max_peak_swe |> round(1)` kg m^-2^ (@fig-swe-ann-peak) across all sites and years. The CP25 model tended to underestimate both mean and peak SWE at these three colder sites while E10 overestimated SWE at all four sites.

### Evaluation of Snowpack Models

Over all years and sites, the CP25 model had a lower mean bias of `r cp25_mb |> round(2)` kg m^-2^ compared to E10's mean bias of `r e10_mb |> round(2)` kg m^-2^  in representing the individual subcanopy SWE measurements shown in @fig-swe-ts. Across the three colder climate sites (i.e., Fortress, Marmot, and Wolf Creek) CP25 underestimated SWE (MB = `r cp25_no_rc_mb |> round(2)` kg m^-2^) and E10 overestimated SWE (MB = `r e10_no_rc_mb |> round(2)` kg m^-2^). CP25 had its smallest mean bias at Fortress of `r cp25_fm_mb |> round(2)` kg m^-2^—where the canopy snow energy and mass balance parameterisations were developed—followed by Marmot, Wolf Creek, and Russell. E10 had its lowest mean bias at Marmot—where this canopy snow model had previously been tested and developed—followed by Wolf Creek, Fortress, and Russell (@tbl-swe-mb). Both the CP25 and E10 models had relatively similar performance at Marmot and Wolf Creek based on their mean biases which had absolute values which differed by less than 1 kg m^-2^ (@tbl-swe-mb). Although E10 had a marginally reduced mean bias at Wolf Creek of `r e10_wc_mb |> round(2)` kg m^-2^ compared to `r cp25_wc_mb |> round(2)` kg m^-2^ for CP25 the RMSE across all sites was lower for CP25 (@tbl-swe-mb). The lower RMSE for CP25 compared to E10 is also reflected in CP25's closer estimates to mean and peak seasonal SWE across all water years across all four sites compared to E10 (@fig-swe-ann-mean; @fig-swe-ann-peak). Three years contributed to the higher RMSE at Marmot where E10 simulated SWE was greatly overestimated based on a mean and peak value by over 50 kg m^-2^ (nearly 100% of observed SWE) for the water years 2011 and 2012 (@fig-swe-ann-mean; @fig-swe-ann-peak). In contrast, E10 had a very large underestimation in subcanopy SWE at Marmot for the water year 2019. At Wolf Creek, E10 also had deviations of ~30 kg m^-2^ (~100% greater than observed SWE) from observed mean and peak seasonal SWE for 2016 and 2017. Both models had their worst overall performance for the temperate-maritime Russell site; however, CP25 did show a substantial improvement compared to the E10 model with mean biases of `r cp25_rc_mb |> round(2)` kg m^-2^ and `r e10_rc_mb |> round(2)` kg m^-2^ respectively. Although the intent of this evaluation is to assess the performance of each model in simulating subcanopy SWE, uncertainties in model forcing and physical parameters (i.e., canopy coverage, LAI) may also contribute to systematic biases in the evaluation. Some of the increased model error at Russell during the 2008 water year may reflect the use of total precipitation data from a nearby highway station rather than on-site measurements.

Seasonal subcanopy SWE accumulation and ablation was generally well represented by both models at Fortress, Marmot, and Wolf Creek (@fig-swe-ts). However, E10 failed to simulate the timing of SWE accumulation and ablation well for 2011, 2012, and 2019 at Marmot. The largest deviation in simulated seasonal SWE occurred at Russell for E10 where subcanopy snow accumulation was simulated at a much higher rate compared to the observed and CP25 over the two years that were simulated. At Wolf Creek CP25 had a delay in simulating the initial accumulation of subcanopy SWE for water years 2017, 2018, and 2019. The lower snowfall rate at Wolf Creek and higher interception rate for CP25 compared to E10 led to throughfall and unloading rates that were smaller than the snowpack initiation threshold employed in Snobal, which Snobal then melts SWE accumulations below this threshold completely. In contrast, E10 intercepted less snow and had higher unloading rates than CP25 leading to higher initial accumulation for these three years at Wolf Creek.

![Timeseries of observed and simulated (CP25 and E10) forest snow water equivalent at each station.](figs/figure5.png){#fig-swe-ts}

### Snowfall Partitioning {#sec-sf-partition}

A greater fraction of annual snowfall was sublimated by CP25 compared to E10 for all four sites across all years (@fig-frac-subl). Lower interception efficiency combined with higher average rates of unloading for the E10 model led to more snowfall being partitioned towards the ground compared to the CP25 model (@fig-frac-unld) leading to reduced sublimation of canopy snow and thus overprediction of subcanopy SWE accumulation (@tbl-swe-mb). The underprediction of subcanopy SWE by the CP25 model at Fortress, Marmot, and Wolf Creek (@tbl-swe-mb) may have been due to an overestimate of sublimation and/or canopy snowmelt rates leading to less snowfall being partitioned to the ground as solid snow. The difference in the annual fraction of snowfall that was sublimated between the CP25 and E10 models was most prevalent at Marmot (@fig-frac-subl). Factors that may contribute to this large deviation include the lower unloading rates observed for CP25 at this site (@fig-frac-unld) compared to E10 resulting from the lower wind speed and air temperatures at this site (@fig-met-normals), reducing the unloading and canopy snowmelt rates thus increasing the amount of canopy snow subject to sublimation for CP25. For E10, the April—June monthly air temperature normals at Marmot—months when this site receives most of its snowfall (@fig-met-normals)—are also largely within the E10 ice-bulb temperature unloading range (-3°C to 6°C) which are ideal conditions for initiating unloading due to warming for the E10 model. Relatively similar fractions of annual snowfall was sublimated by the two models at Fortress and Wolf Creek (@fig-frac-subl) due to the similar sublimation parameterisation used by the two models combined with the similar fraction of snow partitioned towards the ground (@fig-frac-unld). Although CP25 had higher drip/melt rates than E10, increased throughfall by E10 coupled with the constant unloading rate as a function of snow load likely made up for E10's lower melt/drip rate (@fig-frac-drip). Process observations of unloading, melt, and sublimation were not available and thus the simulations of snowfall partitioning could not be directly evaluated.

###  Simulated Canopy Snow Load

Over all years and sites, CP25 predicted consistently higher canopy snow loads compared to the E10 model (@fig-cpy-swe). This results from E10's increase in throughfall with increasing antecedent snow load as well as the constant unloading rate as a function of snow load and ice-bulb temperature and led to more snowfall partitioned to the ground as solid snow compared to CP25 (@fig-frac-unld). Some snowfall events had similar initial accumulation of snow in the canopy between the two models up until the E10 species snow load capacity was reached (see colder events in Jan and Feb at Fortress, Marmot, and Wolf Creek in @fig-cpy-swe-select). Canopy snow load infrequently reached the CP25 maximum load of 50 kg m^-2^ at all four sites (@fig-cpy-swe). At Russell, while annual snowfall amounts were similar to Fortress (@fig-sf-subcpy-swe), increased canopy snow ablation rates due to warmer temperatures at Russell limited the accumulation of snow in the canopy in spring (@fig-cpy-swe; @fig-cpy-swe-select). 

![Timeseries of simulated canopy load for CP25 and E10 at each station for the full simulation period.](figs/figure9.png){#fig-cpy-swe}

In addition to the large difference in canopy load simulated between CP25 and E10 across all four sites, the duration that the canopies of each site were simulated to have more than 2 kg m^-2^ of snow varied between the four sites and two models (@fig-frac-cpy-load-th). A threshold of 2 kg m^-2^ was selected based on observations by @Pomeroy1996 who found minimal influence of canopy snow load on above canopy albedo for loads less than 1.6 kg m^-2^. Across all four sites, canopy loads greater than 2 kg m^-2^ were observed to persist longer for CP25 compared to E10 (@fig-frac-cpy-load-th). At Fortress and Russell snow loads above this threshold persisted up to two times longer for CP25 compared to E10. The difference at Marmot and Wolf Creek between the two models were found to be less due to the lower snowfall of these sites which lowered event canopy snow loads thus yielding higher interception inefficiencies for the E10 model.

## Discussion

### Model Performance in Simulating Subcanopy Snow Accumulation 

New parameterisations of the canopy snow energy and mass balance—supported by advances in process understanding [@Lundquist2021; @Lumbrazo2022; @Staines2023; @Cebulski2025a; @Cebulski2025b]—were evaluated for their ability to simulate subcanopy SWE across a broad range of climate and forest types. The higher canopy snow loads simulated by CP25 are consistent with empirical observations [@Hedstrom1998; @Storck2002; @Calder1990; @Cebulski2025a; @Watanabe1964], which demonstrate a linear increase in interception with snowfall without evidence of reaching a maximum capacity. By calculating throughfall as a function of canopy density [@Staines2023; @Cebulski2025a] and combining this with a comprehensive canopy snow ablation routine [@Lundquist2021; @Cebulski2025b], CP25 resulted in much larger intercepted snow loads compared to E10. Consequently, E10 underestimated subcanopy SWE, as less intercepted snow was exposed to sublimation or melt (@tbl-swe-mb). 

Inclusion of both dry- and melt-induced unloading of canopy snow is supported by observations [@Ellis2010; @Floyd2012; @Roesch2001; @Lumbrazo2022; @Cebulski2025b], with mechanisms such as bond weakening, lubrication during melt, and wind shear reinforcing their physical basis. An energy balance-based canopy melt routine—recommended by many studies [@Storck2002; @Andreadis2009; @Lundquist2021; @Lumbrazo2022; @Cebulski2025b]—improved representation of ablation under warm conditions [@Cebulski2025b] and likely contributed to reduced error in subcanopy SWE simulations in this study at the temperate-maritime Russell site. In contrast, the ice-bulb temperature-based melt threshold (> 6 °C) was infrequently reached and caused unloading to occur mainly as solid snow. While accounting for wind-driven unloading reduced errors slightly in colder sites, the largest improvements were at Russell, where CP25 better captured canopy melt and drip. 

Both models performed best at the sites where they were originally developed (CP25 at Fortress and E10 at Marmot), which aligns with observations by @Lumbrazo2022 that parameters for unloading are site specific and may suggest the initial interception parameters are as well. Low error at the cold sites suggests that the dry snow unloading parameterisation is transferable across sites and is consistent with observations by @Lumbrazo2022—where a wind-driven unloading parameterisation had good accuracy across a cold-climate sites. The CP25 model performed worst at the temperate-maritime Russell site, where melt/drip and melt-induced unloading processes dominated, despite showing improvements over E10 in this study and showing strong performance over warm melt-driven events in @Cebulski2025b. Remaining error at Russell may reflect unrepresented processes, such as rime-ice accumulation observed in other maritime forests [@Lumbrazo2022], which increases canopy loads and alters partitioning into liquid water. Additional uncertainties stem from simplifications in the canopy energy balance (e.g., radiation transmittance, longwave emission, and turbulent fluxes), as well as parameterisations of interception and unloading [@Cebulski2025a; @Cebulski2025b]. These issues are likely amplified at Russell, where frequent air temperatures near the melting point increase sensitivity to energy balance formulations, compared to the colder sites with more stable conditions.

Across the three colder sites, mean bias differed by less than 10 kg m^-2^ between models, yet CP25 simulated longer periods of canopy snow loads greater than 2 kg m^-2^. This has implications for improving the representation of above-canopy albedo in land surface models which have previously shown poor performance with existing canopy snow ablation models [@Thackeray2014; @Wang2016]. Moreover, E10’s performance varied substantially between years; it overestimated SWE over most years, but underestimated SWE in low-snowfall years when reduced unloading rates allowed more sublimation (e.g., Marmot in 2019; @fig-swe-ann-mean). 

These results show that recent process-based parameterisations—particularly the treatment of canopy load, ablation, and unloading—yield measurable improvements in simulating subcanopy SWE across diverse climates and forest types, and have direct implications for representation of surface albedo in land-surface schemes.

### Influence of Climate on Snowfall Partitioning 

Although Russell and Fortress received similar amounts of snowfall (@fig-sf-subcpy-swe), subcanopy accumulation was lower at Russell due to enhanced canopy ablation: ~40% of annual snowfall melted and 20% sublimated in the canopy, compared to ~35% combined losses at Fortress. The low cold content of the maritime snowpack at Russell led to canopy snow drip rarely refreezing, and warmer air temperatures (@fig-met-normals) further promoted melt throughout the season (@fig-swe-ts). The prevalence of snowmelt both in the canopy and on the ground at Russell led to the lowest fraction of seasonal snowfall stored in the subcanopy (0.3) at peak SWE. 

At Fortress, colder conditions, higher snowfall, and greater wind exposure increased unloading rates, limited sublimation despite the meteorological conditions favourable for it (@fig-frac-subl). Combined with low canopy melt (@fig-frac-drip), these processes yielded the highest subcanopy storage fraction (0.6) across all four sites.

Marmot and Wolf Creek experienced cooler, drier conditions and lower snowfall, leading to reduced unloading and a greater role of sublimation in canopy losses (@fig-frac-subl). Canopy melt played only a minor role, but high sublimation fractions meant that only ~0.4 of snowfall remained in the subcanopy snowpack at peak SWE. Simulated sublimation for these two sites (~50% of seasonal snowfall; @fig-frac-subl) exceeded the upper range of global estimates (25–45%) reported by @Essery2003 but is consistent with observations by @Pomeroy1995 and @Ellis2010.

Despite storing the smallest fraction of snowfall, Russell delivered the greatest amount of water to the soil because most canopy ablation occurred as melt and solid snow unloading rather than sublimation. Relatively consisting mid winter melt of snow in the canopy provided a steady year-round input of liquid water, which could contribute to the longer vegetation growing season and may enhance groundwater recharge. Previous studies [@Hayashi2020; @Barnhart2016] highlight that slow, sustained melt increases infiltration opportunity, whereas rapid melt promotes runoff. In contrast, colder sites with fewer mid-winter melt events may partition a greater fraction of precipitation into runoff.

### Influence of Tree Species on Snowfall Partitioning

The species of needleleaf forest overlying each site also influenced subcanopy SWE accumulation. However, limited research has been conducted on how branches elasticity, needle composition, and crown structure affect both the interception and ablation of snow in the canopy. The Marmot and Wolf Creek sites both were primarily composed of spruce trees (@tbl-site-meta) and exposed to similarly cool climates (@fig-met-normals), showed comparable fractions of snowfall stored in the subcanopy and similar canopy melt and sublimation losses (@fig-frac-drip; @fig-frac-subl).

In contrast, Fortress and Russell were both primarily fir-dominated forests, yet diverged strongly due to climate differences (@fig-met-normals) and vegetation structure. Despite only ~20% greater canopy cover, Russell stored about half the fraction of snowfall in the subcanopy compared to Fortress. Tree size is a likely factor: large 50 m tall fir trees at Russell can intercept far more snow than the smaller 10 m fir trees at Fortress. Coupled with low winds, this increased exposure of intercepted snow to canopy energy fluxes favored melt and drip at Russell. The larger, more supportive branches may also have slowed unloading, contributing to CP25’s overestimate of subcanopy SWE at Russell.

These results support earlier theory by @Satterlund1970 that vegetation structure, density, and climate exert stronger control on forest–snow partitioning than needleleaf species alone. However, other forest types, such as broadleaf deciduous or cedar stands, have less supportive branches and different needle or leaf structures, and are therefore expected to exert a stronger influence on canopy–snow processes than the relatively subtle species differences observed among needleleaf sites in this study.

## Conclusions

This study shows that advances in the representation of canopy snow energy and mass balance can substantially improve the snowpack simulations across forests spanning a range of climates and canopy structures. The new physically based canopy snow model reduced errors in simulating subcanopy snowpacks and provided new opportunities to diagnose the processes that govern how snowfall is partitioned between the atmosphere, canopy, and forest floor. Building on recent developments, the new approach replaced earlier theories on the assumption of a maximum canopy snow load with an interception calculation based on canopy density, and represented ablation more explicitly through melt- and wind-driven unloading, energy balance–based melt and drip, and sublimation processes that vary with canopy snow load. Compared with an existing model, the revised approach more accurately represented the melt of intercepted snow, particularly in the coastal–maritime environment, where errors in subcanopy SWE were an order of magnitude lower. These results highlight the robustness of physically based parameterisations under warm conditions, which is particularly important given that continued warming may reduce the applicability of empirically derived routines.

Process diagnosis conducted using the new approach highlighted the role of vegetation in controlling snowfall partitioning. The greatest influence was observed in the temperate–maritime forest, where high energy input to intercepted snow caused nearly half of seasonal snowfall to melt within the canopy, producing the lowest subcanopy SWE fraction and a steady contribution of meltwater throughout the winter. Despite the large influence of vegetation on the subcanopy snowpack, sublimation losses were relatively small (~`r frac_subl_lst[[rc]]`% of seasonal snowfall) due to high humidity. At two cold continental sites with lower annual snowfall, reduced unloading allowed a larger proportion of intercepted snow to be lost to sublimation (~`r (frac_subl_lst[[mc]]+frac_subl_lst[[mc]])/2`%). In contrast, the cold wind-exposed site with higher snowfall exhibited greater unloading, which limited sublimation losses relative to the other cold sites. Overall, climate and canopy density exerted stronger controls on seasonal snowfall partitioning than species-level differences among fir- and spruce-dominated forests.

Although the new model simulated subcanopy SWE well, uncertainties remain in partitioning of snowfall between sublimation losses and liquid water inputs to the forest floor, as direct flux measurements have only been validated at one site in a previous study. Measurements of snow interception, unloading, drip, and sublimation are rarely made at hydrometeorological stations but would provide important data to evaluate and refine process-level representations across differing environments. Further research is also needed to determine how unloading depends on intercepted snow load, as this relationship is likely to vary with both climate and tree characteristics. Greater cohesion and adhesion in humid climates and more supportive branch and needle structures in certain species may influence how snow is retained or shed from canopies. Improved process-level measurements, combined with continued model development, will help to identify these uncertainties and support the transferability of canopy snow models across the wide range of conditions found in cold-region forests.
