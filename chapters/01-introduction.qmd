# Introduction

Melt of the seasonal snowpack directly supports over two billion people worldwide—crucial for downstream ecosystems, energy production, and agricultural irrigation [@Immerzel2020; @Viviroli2020]. The high albedo and energy required to melt snow also provides a large-scale cooling effect for our planet by reflecting most of the incoming solar radiation and dissipating energy during spring melt [@Henderson2018; @Leach2014]. Snowfall in forested areas occurs over 50% of the northern hemisphere [@Kim2017], and over 20% of the global landmass [@Deschamps-Berger2025]. Intercepted snow in the canopy is subjected to higher rates of sublimation and melt compared to the subcanopy snowpack due to greater surface area, turbulent energy exchange, and solar exposure [@Storck2002; @Floyd2012; @Pomeroy1998b]. In cold-dry continental climates, researchers estimate that 25 to 45% of annual snowfall may be lost to the sublimation of intercepted snow from the canopy [@Essery2003; @Sanmiguel-Vallelado2017]. In warm-humid maritime climates the majority of snowfall melts in the canopy [@Storck2002; @Floyd2012], limiting atmospheric losses from sublimation, and contributes to changes in the phase and timing of precipitation reaching the subcanopy. The strong hydrological influence of forest canopies leads to high variability of snowpack accumulation in forested basins. Observations of this variability is not well represented due to a sparse and unrepresentative network of in situ observations, which are mostly located in clearings [@Vionnet2021]. Moreover, observing snow accumulation under forest canopies at large extents remains uncertain with current remote sensing technologies [@Rittger2020]. Thus, there is a need for reliable models of snow redistribution by forest to estimate snow accumulation [@Pomeroy2022; @Clark2015] and to diagnose the impact of changing climate and vegetation cover on snowpack accumulation [@Immerzeel2020; @Lopez-Moreno2014; @Viviroli2020]. 

Limited observations of forest-snow processes including throughfall, unloading, sublimation, drip, and melt of canopy snow have limited process understanding and led to uncertainties in representing these processes in hydrological models [@Lundquist2021]. Existing snow interception parameterisations have been developed for both warm maritime [@Storck2002; @Andreadis2009] and cold continental [@Hedstrom1998; @Ellis2010; @Roesch2001] climates characterized by dense forest canopy. The strong dependence of snowfall partitioning by vegetation on meteorology and canopy density has challenged earlier parameterisations that were developed and tested in distinct climates in dense forest canopies. As a result these parameterisations often need to be calibrated when applied to new sites to better represent canopy snow interception [e.g., @Lumbrazo2022]. Although accurate performance in simulating subcanopy SWE has been achieved across different climates in some studies [@Essery2004; @Gelfan2004], other snow model comparisons [@Krinner2018; @Rutter2009] have shown limited performance. The omission or simplified representation of processes and reliance on empirically derived coefficients likely contribute to model uncertainty when applied in climates and forests where other processes become important [@Rutter2009; @Krinner2018; @Lumbrazo2022; @Roth2019; @Moeser2015; @Lundquist2021]. 

In hydrological models, the partitioning of snowfall in forest canopies is typically handled using parameterisations to calculate the fraction of snowfall that is intercepted in the canopy (hereafter initial interception) and also parameterisations for ablation processes including unloading, melt/drip, and sublimation [@Clark2015; @Pomeroy2022]. @Lundquist2021 and @Staines2023 show that parameterisations developed by @Hedstrom1998 and @Storck2002 typically used in hydrological and land surface models [@Clark2015; @Pomeroy2022; @Verseghy2017] may overemphasize the role of increasing canopy snow load increasing throughfall of snow in the initial interception process. However, the snow loads observed by @Staines2023 were relatively small, and thus their observations should be confirmed using aerial lidar observations over larger snowfall events and variable canopy densities and also over longer time scale using detailed lysimetry. 

Most studies emphasize the importance of representing both dry/cold- and melt-induced unloading of snow in the canopy [@Roesch2001; @Ellis2010]. These processes are supported through physical mechanisms such as loss of structural integrity, particle bond weakening, and lubrication of intercepted snow during the melt process [@Storck2002; @Floyd2012]. Sublimation promotes unloading via structural degradation and bond weakening of intercepted snow [@Macdonald2010]. Wind drag promotes unloading through shear stress applied to intercepted snow, wind erosion through direct entrainment in the atmosphere of intercepted snow, and branch movement [@Roesch2001; @Bartlett2015; @Lumbrazo2022]. Increasing air temperature promotes unloading by increasing the elasticity of branches and its association with melt and/or sublimation [@Schmidt1990; @Schmidt1991]. While direct measurements of canopy snow unloading associated with melt were provided using detailed process-level lysimetry by @Storck2002 dry-snow unloading parameterisation have been developed using indirect measurements from above canopy albedo [@Roesch2001; @Bartlett2015]. Therefore, validation of the theories underlying dry-snow unloading parameterisations would benefit from additional direct observations of canopy snow unloading. Moreover, the canopy snowmelt induced unloading association proposed by @Storck2002 was based on a single event and thus should be validated using additional observations. Additional processes currently not encoded in snow interception models include wind redistribution of snow, rain on intercepted snow, hoarfrost, rime ice and the cohesion and adhesion of snow in the canopy which will also be investigated.

Future climate change is expected to change the dominant hydrological processes in mountain forests [@He2021; @Dettinger2014; @Viviroli2011; @Fang2020b]. A report by Environment and Climate Change Canada [@Bush2019], suggest an increase in air temperature of 2 °C from the 1986-2005 reference period by 2050 for the low emission scenario and 6 °C for the high emission scenario by the late 21^st^ century. @Bush2019 project an increase in annual mean precipitation over all of Canada during the second half of the 21^st^ century, with a larger increase in northern Canada. As the climate warms, regions such as continental climates in Canada may shift from a dry-snow unloading and sublimation dominated regime to more influences from canopy snowmelt and drip processes. Thus, additional investigations on both melt- and dry-snow unloading are warranted to better understand both processes that are expected to become more prevalent in Canada with climate change. 

In addition to shifting snow processes as a result of climate change, vegetation cover has already started experiencing changes resulting from drought [@Dai2013], disease [@Ruess2021], insects [@Kurz2008], fire [@Kasischke2006; @Kasischke2010], changing land use [@Lopez-Moreno2014], and changing species [@Gottfried2012]. These changes in temperature, precipitation, along with the changing forest species, structure, and density are expected to have strong modifications on snowpack accumulation worldwide. However, since snow interception and ablation parameterisation were developed in distinct cold or warm climates with dense canopy structure there is a need to ensure these parameterisations are transferable across diverse climate and forest canopies.

To assess the performance of existing parameterisations, a modular and flexible model platform will be used to simulate the individual mass and energy balance fluxes and states of the canopy and snowpack. The advantage of modular and flexible model platforms is that it is possible to adjust process parameterisations while holding the remaining model parameters and mass and energy conservation equations constant [@Pomeroy2022; @Clark2015]. The Cold Regions Hydrological Model platform [CRHM, @Pomeroy2022] will be used in this study as its snow interception algorithms have been successfully used in previous studies [@Ellis2010; @Pomeroy2012; @Rasouli2019b; @Sanmiguel2022] to assess snow interception processes in Spain, USA, and Canada. Since CRHM is a process-based model agnostic platform, individual state and flux variables including subcanopy snow accumulation, snow interception, sublimation, unloading, drip, and wind redistribution can be evaluated using differing parameterisations. To evaluate existing parameterisations of snow interception [@Hedstrom1998;@Storck2002;@Andreadis2009], and ablation of canopy snow by unloading [@Ellis2010; @Roesch2001; @Andreadis2009], drip [@Storck2002;@Andreadis2009; @Ellis2010] and sublimation [@Pomeroy1998b] CRHM will be run at four mountain forest research basins across western Canada and compared to in-situ observations. Insights gained from an evaluation of the theoretical underpinnings and assumptions on new and archival field observations will help inform the improvement of existing snow interception process representations. Modifications to the existing parameterisations to better represent snow interception processes will be validated on the associated change in error in simulated and observed forest snow accumulation and streamflow.

## Research Objectives

The overarching goal of this thesis is to better understand the dominant processes that govern snow accumulation in forested environments and to determine how these processes can be accurately represented in hydrological models. To achieve this goal, two specific research objectives were formulated.

### Objective 1: Evaluate the suitability of existing snow interception and ablation parameterisations for application in needleleaf forests with differing canopy structure and meteorology.

To address this objective, three research questions were developed each corresponding to individual journal articles:

1. What are the theoretical underpinnings and assumptions behind existing snow interception and ablation parameterisations?  
   
2. Are the theories and assumptions of existing snow interception parameterisations supported by field measurements collected across diverse canopy structures and meteorological conditions?  
   
3. Are the theories and assumptions of existing canopy snow ablation parameterisations supported by field measurements collected across varying meteorological conditions?

### Objective 2: Determine how new snow interception and ablation parameterisations could enhance the representation of processes important for subcanopy snow accumulation. 

For Objective 2, the following research question was developed:

4. How can the use of novel snow interception parameterisations enhance simulations of snow accumulation in forests with differing tree species, canopy structures, and meteorological conditions?

## Organization of Chapters

This thesis is structured to follow a progression from a literature review of existing theories and identifying research gaps, then to a field-based evaluation of these theories, and finally to model development. 

Following the Introduction of the thesis (Chapter 1), Chapter 2 addresses Research Question 1 by providing a comprehensive review of the literature on snow interception and ablation parameterisations. This review identified the theories and assumptions underlying existing parameterisations and highlights the primary research gaps that this thesis seeks to address. The outcomes of Chapter 2 provide the foundation for evaluating parameterisations using field observations in the subsequent chapters.

Chapter 3 addresses Research Question 2 and presents a field-based evaluation of canopy snow interception. Using novel in-situ observations collected at high spatial and temporal resolution, this chapter quantifies snow interception processes prior to ablation and building on existing studies presents a new canopy density metric that accounts for the trajectory of incoming snowfall. The results demonstrate inconsistencies in existing parameterisations and show improved representation of the initial interception process with a new parameterisation across diverse meteorology, snow loads, and canopy densities.

Chapter 4 addresses Research Question 3 and evaluates canopy snow ablation processes, including unloading, melt, and drip. Observations reveal that the drivers of canopy snow ablation differ from existing theories, with canopy snow load, wind shear stress, and snowmelt strongly associated with unloading. These findings highlight the need for revised parameterisations to accurately represent canopy snow ablation. Collectively, Chapters 2 through 4 demonstrate the successful achievement of Objective 1.

Chapter 5 addresses Objective 2 (Research Question 4) and describes the development of a new canopy snow model that incorporates the relationships identified in Chapters 3 and 4. The model is implemented in the Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling Platform across four research sites in western and northern Canada. Results demonstrate improved simulations of subcanopy snow water equivalent (SWE), particularly under warm-humid climates dominated by canopy snow melt, validating the new parameterisations.

The thesis concludes with Chapter 6 which provides a synthesis of the results and conclusions from the previous chapters.
